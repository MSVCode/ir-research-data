Larry King?s Marital Monkey Trials

Ever wonder what dinner-table conversation between Larry King and wife No. 7, country singer Shawn Southwick-King, is like? At the premiere of Walk the Line, they discussed intelligent design with a reporter. Larry: I know the world is more than 5,000 years old. I mean, that?s ridiculous. Shawn: Don?t say ridiculous! Larry: Honey, they?ve found bones 3 million years old. It?s insane. Shawn: But don?t call other people?s beliefs ridiculous. Larry: I?m gonna hit her. How?s this? The thought that the world is only 5,000 years old is hard to conceive. Shawn: There you go! Larry: Now, could there have been intelligent design? Could be. Then we could also say, who designed the intelligent designer? Shawn: All good questions, Larry, but impossible? Larry: ?to answer? I?m in the answer business! Shawn: All right, put all of the pieces of a clock into a bag, shake it, and expect it to come out working. That?s the big-bang theory. Larry: But if I shook it up, and it worked, that would not be intelligent, that would be random. Shawn: Yeah . . . Larry: So if intelligent design designed this, who designed the designer? Shawn: A designer! Larry: I?m saving my arguments for the Supreme Court.
