POPE LYING IN STATE OF GRACE

April 5, 2005 -- A sea of humanity half a million strong � forming a line that stretched for two miles � waited for hours to bid a tear-filled farewell to Pope John Paul II as he lay in state in St. Peter's Basilica last night.

The poignant scene came after young pilgrims saluted the pontiff with their cellphones � taking a final photo of the man who worked so hard to bring the young back to the church � as his body was borne through St. Peter's Square and into the church.

Once inside the basilica, many wept as they walked past the bier. Others collapsed against a wall in tears after they left the 16th century church, where the pope's funeral will be held Friday.

"His face was suffering," said Sister Emma, a 76-year-old Italian nun. "I felt a sense of sadness, even though I know he's in heaven."

The pope who traveled the world made his final journey on the shoulders of 12 white-gloved pallbearers who carried his crimson stretcher from his home in the Vatican to the basilica, where he will be interred in a grotto.

Once his body was inside, cardinals in red robes and caps filed past the 84-year-old pontiff's body � bowing and crossing themselves � then tens of thousands of weeping, praying pilgrims began snaking into the church.

They dabbed at tears as they circled the body, clad in a scarlet velvet robe.

The pope's hands were folded across his chest. On his head was a white bishop's miter and tucked under his left arm was a staff topped with a crucifix.

On his feet were a pair of the simple brown leather shoes he wore on many of his trips to more than 120 countries during his 26 years as pope.

The Italian RAI television network said half a million people had turned out. Police said the line was two miles long and many people wide.

People chanted and clapped hands before entering St. Peter's Square, but once they did, they fell silent as if entering a holy place.

Once inside, many took pictures with their phones before being whisked away by attendants.

Francis Cardinal George of Chicago said it was "quite moving" to see John Paul "laid out as if he were going to celebrate Mass."

The pontiff looked "at peace, but a man who had suffered," the cardinal said. "You see the face of death very clearly."

Sister Maximina Semita, a Mexican nun who happened to be on a pilgrimage to Rome when the pope died, waited in line for eight hours to view the body.

"Walking toward him in that church � so big, so grandiose � was like walking into heaven towards a saint," she said.

"I felt many emotions, sadness at our loss and joy that he is in heaven. The experience has strengthened my vocation."

The stretcher carrying the pope began its journey in Clementine Hall of the Vatican's Apostolic Palace, where John Paul's body had lain in state for dignitaries following his death Saturday night.

Twelve bow-tied, white-gloved Papal Gentlemen, Vatican officials who were acting as pallbearers, carried the stretcher on their shoulders. Swiss Guards wearing red-plumed helmets and carrying halberds flanked the pallbearers.

The solemn procession made its way through frescoed hallways, down marble stairways, through the Bronze Door and into the warm sunshine of St. Peter's Square, which was packed with 100,000 of the faithful.

As the body emerged, the huge throng applauded, a traditional Italian sign of respect for the dead.

On the top step of the basilica, the pallbearers turned the body around so the pope could face the square � where he had presided over thousands of Masses � for a final time.

Catholic cardinals, meeting yesterday for the first time since the pope's death, decided to hold his funeral on Friday at 10 a.m. Rome time, or 4 a.m. EDT.

President Bush will be among 200 world leaders who will attend.
