Bus hits overpass in Boston, injuring passengers



BOSTON  A charter bus carrying 42 passengers crashed when it attempted to pass under a bridge in Boston on Saturday night, leaving several people injured and trapped inside, authorities said.

The bus was coming from Harvard University and was heading back to Pennsylvania when it struck an overpass in the Allston neighborhood around 7:30 p.m., according to the Boston Fire Department. Massachusetts State Police said several people aboard the bus were injured, though it had no immediate details on the nature of the injuries.

State Police said the Calvary Coach Bus out of Philadelphia was too high for the roadway. A spokesman for the bus company said he had no immediate information on the crash.

Photos posted on the Fire Department's website showed firefighters standing on the top of the bus using boards to extract people. The last victim was freed from the bus around 9 p.m., the department said on Twitter.

The accident happened on Soldiers Field Road, a major crosstown roadway in Boston that curves along the Charles River and passes by Harvard and Boston University. It is a major roadway to the Massachusetts Turnpike.
