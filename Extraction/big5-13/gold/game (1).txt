iPhone Game Targeted At Children Charges $99 For In-App Purchases
Certain gaming apps are known to push their luck when it comes to recommending in-app purchases, but a platform game featuring characters ripped straight out of Pokemon and Mario Bros. asks players (read: kids of unsuspecting parents) to pay as much as $99 to enhance game-play.

The game, snappily titled Super Monster Bros by Adventure Time Pocket Free Games, was discovered by IGN, which posted a video demonstrating the minefield of in-app purchase pop-ups during game play.

There’s an option before the game even starts to purchase characters ranging in price from $5 to $99. Any player who wants to make a purchase would have to know the device’s iTunes password for it to go through, though.

The game was posted on Feb. 23, 2013, and has consistently received one-star reviews on iTunes: “Boring for adults and could easily trick kids into spending money,” says one.

Who made it? A link underneath the description section of its iTunes page points to CocoaChina, otherwise known as Chukong Technologies, China’s biggest mobile apps developer. The company received $14 million in Series B funding in 2011 from investors including Sequoia China.

But this appears to be yet another ruse by the game developer. A spokesman from CocoaChina tells me that this is “absolutely not” their game, and that they have “no connection whatsoever to the named developer.”

The “seller” of the game is listed as Mario Games Casas Team, which appears to have made two other similar iPhone games with saturated cartoon-like rendering, and more scammy in-app purchase options.
