Drunk Frenchmen steal llama, take it joyriding

There’s drunk — and then there’s llama-stealing-joyride drunk!

A pack of blitzed French school chums snatched Serge the llama from a circus and led the surprisingly agreeable beast on a late-night journey aboard the city of Bordeaux’s tram system.

The llama-nappers posted pictures of themselves with Serge on Twitter, leading to their arrests on misdemeanor theft charges. They’ll likely get a wrist-slapping fine.

“I had two or three glasses too much. Let’s say I was happy,” one of the animal liberators, Mathieu, 20, told the Sud-Ouest newspaper.

The lifelong pals broke into the Franco-Italian Circus looking to grab a zebra, but that animal wasn’t cooperative.

Serge, however, was more than game for some wild-and-woolly, late-night action.

“We were afraid that [Serge] would be rough, but he was very gentle,” Mathieu said. “We petted him and he followed us onto the street.”

The blotto buddies baptized Serge with booze and renamed him “Kuzco,” after the Inca ruler in Disney’s cartoon “The Emperor’s New Groove.”

“[Serge] was happy and proud [to be temporarily free],” Mathieu said.

“It changed him. It was not a militant act to liberate a circus animal. This is just something we decided to do on the fly.”

The drunken stunt finally ended when a tram conductor came upon the five Frenchmen and their four-legged travel companion.

Of course Serge didn’t have a ticket and had to get off the street car.

“The inspector made him get off and [we] tied [him] to a lamppost,” Mathieu told BFM TV.

Serge was not harmed and was reunited with the circus.

Circus director John Beautour didn’t find the stunt very funny.

“They should be made aware that to take an animal under the effect of alcohol just to have fun in a town on a public causeway could have ended very badly for all concerned,” the circus chief said.
