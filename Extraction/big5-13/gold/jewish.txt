Head of Gestapo buried in Jewish cemetery



The brutal head of Hitler’s Gestapo who was also one of the evil architects of the Holocaust has been buried since 1945 in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, according to a German newspaper.

Heinrich Mueller – known as “Gestapo-Mueller” during World War II – was long thought to have survived the war.

But new documents and evidence show he was buried in a common grave in a Jewish cemetery in central Berlin, according to the newspaper Bild.

“Mueller didn’t survive the end of the war,” Johannes Tuchel, head of the Memorial to the German Resistance, told the paper.

“His body was interred in 1945 in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte in a mass grave.”

The news infuriated Dieter Graumann, a leader of Germany’s Jewish community.

“That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is a distasteful monstrosity. The memory of the victims is being treated here with contempt,” he told Bild.

Mueller attended the Wannsee Conference near Berlin in January 1942 at which the “Final Solution,” a plan to exterminate Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe, was hatched.
