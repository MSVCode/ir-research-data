OFFICIALS: FOREIGN OBJECT SUCKED INTO JET ENGINE

 Mechanics and engineers suspect some kind of foreign object got sucked into the engine of an American Airlines jet that made an emergency landing at Kennedy Airport, airline officials said today.

The mystery object wasn't a bird, the airline said. A bird strike caused a US Airways jet to ditch in the Hudson River in January.

Airline spokesman Tim Smith couldn't say whether the object was pulled into the engine during Wednesday's takeoff or on a previous flight.

"There was nothing in our previous maintenance checks to indicate any issue that could be related or connected to the failure of this engine," the airline said in a statement.

American says the engine, built by Pratt and Whitney, was maintained according to the manufacturer's and Federal Aviation Administration standards.

The MD-83 jet, carrying 88 passengers and five crew, was headed from LaGuardia Airport to Chicago on Wednesday morning when one of its engines failed, and the pilot declared an emergency.

The plane spewed debris over College Point, Queens, damaging some car windows and the roof of a plumbing business.

The jet landed safely at Kennedy Airport minutes later. No one was hurt aboard the plane or on the ground.
