NO RIHANNA ON OPRAH

 Today's "Oprah," devoted entirely to Chris Brown's alleged beating of girlfriend Rihanna, was standard-issue Oprah Winfrey in both style and substance.

While neither Brown nor Rihanna made a surprise appearance in Winfrey's studio--deflating several Internet rumors--their headline-grabbing troubles were the sole focus of today's show (4 p.m./Ch. 7).

Brown, 19, has been charged with two felonies for his alleged beating of Rihanna, 21, last month in LA.

"Ever since I heard the details of the attack, I wanted to do this show, because the message this story sends to teen girls and boys everywhere is disturbing and also dangerous," Winfrey said.

"We all need to try to evolve from this moment, to use this moment to allow our society to being to grow.

"This show is dedicated to all the Rihannas of the world and to any young men who could ever think about hurting a woman."

Winfrey's main guest was fellow talk show host Tyra Banks, who said she'd been "emotionally" (but not physically) abused by a boyfriend years ago.

Banks also has some insight into Brown's behavior, having interviewed him several years back on "Tyra"--when he admitted that seeing his mother physically abused by her boyfriend caused him to wet his bed for years. Winfrey played a clip from that appearance.

Winfrey and Banks spent the bulk of the hour discussing Brown's behavior toward Rihanna, taking questions from the "Oprah" audience and speaking with several young women who've been in abusive relationships--including one teen who's now pregnant with her abusive boyfriend's child.
