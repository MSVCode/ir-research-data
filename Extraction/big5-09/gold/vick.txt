MICHAEL VICK OUT OF PRISON

 RICHMOND, Va. Suspended NFL star Michael Vick has left a federal lockup in Kansas, apparently bound for Virginia for a bankruptcy hearing next week.

The U.S. Bureau of Prisons Web site shows that Vick is no longer at the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kan. It lists his status as "in transit."

It's not clear when he left, or where he is right now. But two weeks ago, a bankruptcy judge in Newport News, Va. ordered the former Atlanta Falcons quarterback to testify at an April 2nd hearing on his Chapter 11 reorganization plan.

Judge Frank Santoro also ordered Vick to pay the costs of traveling to Virginia for the hearing.

Vick is serving 23 months for a dogfighting conspiracy. He's eligible to move into home confinement on May 21 and is scheduled to be released July 20.
