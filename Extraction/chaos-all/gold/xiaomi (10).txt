Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 becomes fastest-selling smartphone in India

Phone has sold more than one million units in under two months 

Xiaomi says its new Redmi Note 4 has become the fastest selling smartphone in India. 

The Chinese firm said it had moved more than one million units in just 45 days since its launch, meaning one sold every four seconds. 

The phone is the successor to the Redmi Note 3, which shifted more than 2.3 million units in the country following its 2016 launch, making it the best-selling smartphone in India in terms of online sales.

"Redmi Note 4 has become the fastest smartphone model to sell a million units in India. Redmi Note 4 has sold more than one million units in 45 days from its first sale on 23 January, 2017," Xiaomi said. 

"Last month, we had also announced that Redmi Note 4's first sale was the largest sale in the history of the Indian smartphone industry when we sold more than 250,000 units in just 10 minutes across mi.com and Flipkart."

The Redmi Note 4 comes with a 5.5-inch full HD display and 13MP rear camera. It has three different memory/storage variants - the 2GB RAM/32GB model costs 9,999 Rupees (£125), the 3GB RAM/32GB model is priced at 10,999 Rupees (£135) and the 4GB RAM/64GB model is 12,999 Rupees (£160).

Xiaomi is also rumoured to be launching the Redmi Pro 2, the successor to the Redmi Pro, next month. 

Exact details of the new phone are yet to be released.
