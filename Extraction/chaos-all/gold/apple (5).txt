Here’s How Apple Shares Could Hit $200
One analyst says Apple is likely worth $175 within three years, but he also lays out a scenario for the stock hitting $200. 

Apple shares keep going up in anticipation of the iPhone 8 launch later this year, but for the most part Wall Street is already looking at what comes next, after the September iPhone launch. 

While UBS analyst Steven Milunovich currently sees limited upside for Apple in the next year -- the stock may rise perhaps 5% from its current $144 -- he sees more potential over the long term. In his view, Apple shares could realistically hit $175 in the next two to three years (a 22% rise). But he says $200 (a 39% jump) is possible if products besides the iPhone really take off.

Here’s what it would take for Apple’s stock price to hit $200 by 2019, according to Milunovich.

• This fall’s iPhone 8 ushers in a “supercycle” of phone upgrades, and investors feel confident that next fall’s lineup will also be strong.

• Apple’s “other hardware” business, consisting of products like the Apple Watch and AirPods, starts seeing “strong growth” of 20% next fiscal year. Right now, investors are primarily focused on quarterly iPhone sales and the potential of Apple’s “services” business. The company would have to show that its wearables have mass appeal and that the overall Apple ecosystem is “more sticky” than investors originally thought.

• The company’s price-to-earnings ratio rises from 14 currently to 16 -- or even higher, starting next year. If investors have more confidence in Apple’s potential going forward, they’ll likely pay more for every dollar the company earns. Were Apple to enter a completely new category, such as transportation, Milunovich says investors might “believe Apple has caught the next major trend and see a decent runway for growth,” pushing Apple’s price-to-earnings ratio above 17 times two years from now.

• Apple buys back more of its stock. That reduces the number of shares outstanding, meaning that the company’s per-share profits increase.

Big Picture: For the company’s shares to head significantly higher, Apple will have to show investors that it has more than just a few iPhone launches in store.
