This Seven-Layered Burger Sold For Rs 6.53 Lakhs In Dubai To Raise Money For Breast Cancer Awareness

Dubai is no stranger to extravagance, from the tallest buildings to luxury cars, and of course, food is no exception. 

Now joining the bandwagon of expensive grub, is a massive burger dubbed as the ‘Seven Emirates Burgerstack’, that went under the hammer for a whopping  $10,000 (approx Rs 6.54 lakhs).

The burger was auctioned to raise money for a charity during the Pink Caravan’s Pink Bite breast cancer charity event in Dubai Mall's Galeries Lafayette 

Wondering what's the Wow Factor? 

Ingredients in the world's most expensive burger include aged cheddar and veal bacon placed in a saffron brioche burger bun with 7 spices and burger sauce, served with a milkshake.

The winning bid for the burgerstack was called by Asma Al Fahim, founder of a Dubai lifestyle magazine Villa 88. 

"Two years ago we broke the world record by selling one burger for $7,000, and this year we wanted to top that. All proceeds will go to breast cancer awareness and free detection at an earlier stage." the CNN quoted Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdullah Al Thani, a member of Qatar's royal family. 

The auction organised by Pink Caravan, is actively spreading awareness about Breast Cancer in a society that's deeply orthodox. 

"We may be celebrating 2017 as the ‘UAE Year of Giving’ but, for the people of this nation, every year is," Al Thani told CNN
