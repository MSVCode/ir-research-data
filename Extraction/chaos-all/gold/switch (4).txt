At last night's 'Nindies showcase' events, Nintendo showed off some of the titles that'd be making up it's 2017 indie offerings. The catalog has a variety of different genres, including Playtronic Games' Yooka Laylee and ConcernedApe's Stardew Valley.

Nintendo have promised that the showcase was filled with games that embrace the entire gamut of Switch's features, taking advantage of the consoles many quirks and features. They're looking to bring a 60 indie games to the platform before the end of 2017, some of them popular hits from other platforms, sequels and also new titles that will take advantage of the Switch's Joy-con controllers, HD rumbles and easy portability.

An offering of 60+ indie titles would be a strong showing for Nintendo, who struggled with third party and indie support for the Wii U. Embargos for the console review is coming up later today, with review embargoes for its big launch title — Zelda: Breath of the Wild — coming tomorrow.
