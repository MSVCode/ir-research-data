Steve Bannon: Qatar is just as important as North Korea

Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon said the isolation of Qatar is as important as the United States' confrontation with a nuclear-armed North Korea.

"I think the single most important thing that's happening in the world is the situation in Qatar," Bannon said at the Hudson Institute on Monday. "What's happening in Qatar is every bit as important as what's happening in North Korea."

Bannon expressed support for the group of countries, led by Saudi Arabia, that cut ties with Qatar in June after it was suspected Qatar had financially assisted terrorist groups. He also said Qatar must be held accountable for potentially assisting the Muslim Brotherhood and "radical Islamic terrorism."

Qatar's isolation began after Trump's visit to the Middle East in June when he called on Middle Eastern countries to halt terrorist financing.

"I don't think it was just by happenstance that two weeks after the summit that we saw the blockade by the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain and Egypt and the king of Saudi Arabia on Qatar," Bannon said Monday.

Egypt, Bahrain, and the UAE also are part of the coalition.

After leaving the White House, Bannon is now once again serving as executive chairman of Breitbart News.
