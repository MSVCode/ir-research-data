Microsoft Reveals Xbox Scorpio’s Impressive Specs

According to the report on Digital Foundry and Eurogamer, the GPU of the Scorpio will be 4.6 times more powerful than the standard Xbox One. Interestingly, Xbox Project Scorpio doesn’t require games to specifically be designed for the platform, and will also run Xbox One games.

On Twitter, gaming tech analysis site Digital Foundry announced Tuesday it would have an exclusive reveal for Project Scorpio. The company said Project Scorpio would feature an eight-core CPU and have six teraflops of GPU power, but that was about it.

Scorpio is a significant boost over the Xbox One, and is slightly more powerful than the PS4 Pro. This console is being in a lot of rumors and speculations since a year ago, and now that it will officially unveil, millions of the console’s fans and gamers are surely excited for this event. What this essentially means is that the Scorpio should be able to achieve 4K rather easily and still have enough power left over for other things. So, colour us interested. Like the Xbox One, the Xbox Scorpio will have an HDMI port at the back and will sport an integrated Blu-ray optical drive. Additionally, Microsoft says the new console can even improve on the current Xbox games with smoother frame-rates, improved texture filtering, faster loading, and more.

Interestingly, the 8GB of memory – which is up from the 5GB found in the original Xbox One – allows the console to process art assets, making it easier to run 4K resolution visuals at higher speeds. That’s slightly more than the PS4 Pro which runs at 2.1Ghz.

With the unveiling of Project Scorpio’s specs overnight, the gaming world is preparing to move into the 4K era.

First announced at E3 previous year, the newest hardware promises a significant improvement in raw computational power.

We’re sure to see more from Scorpio, including its price tag and how Microsoft plans to take advantage of its power for this fall’s line-up, at E3.
