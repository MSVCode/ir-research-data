Garbage bags sent to clean Mount Everest

Huge garbage bags are being sent with climbers on Mount Everest to collect rubbish that can then be taken by helicopter back to base camp.

Damodar Parajuli, of the Expedition Operators Association of Nepal, says bags are being sent to the Everest base camp to be carried by climbers, guides and porters to higher elevations.

Each bag can hold up to 80kg of rubbish.

Climbers say it is urgent to remove garbage left by previous expeditions from Camp 2 on the mountain.
