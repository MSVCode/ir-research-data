Xbox Boss Teases E3 Plans
"I want to give our games more time on stage at E3."

With E3 2017 still a few months away, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has now spoken out to say that fans can expect Microsoft to dedicate more time to games during the presentation.

Writing on Twitter, Spencer said, "I want to give our games more time on stage at E3. I sometimes feel like we rush telling the story of our games at E3."

This is not to say that the briefing will be exclusively focused on software. It most certainly won't be, as Microsoft's Project Scorpio is coming out this year. However, Spencer's new comments do lend further credence to the suggestion that Microsoft may hold an event dedicated to Scorpio before E3.

Microsoft's E3 2017 briefing is slated to take place on the afternoon of Sunday, June 11. This is a change for Microsoft, as the company historically holds its presentation on the Monday of E3 week.
