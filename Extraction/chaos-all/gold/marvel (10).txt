‘Marvel’s New Warriors’ TV Series Coming To Freeform Next Year, Features Squirrel Girl

Marvel TV, ABC Signature and Freeform are currently collaborating on a live-action adaption of Cloak & Dagger, which is slated to premiere next year. And the entertainment companies have announced their second television project: Marvel’s New Warriors.
MARVEL’S NEW WARRIORS WILL AIR ON FREEFORM NEXT YEAR

Unsurprisingly, the upcoming television series will be based upon the comic of the same name. New Warriors will consist of 30 episodes, and it’s billed as Marvel TV’s first comedy.

However, while the New Warriors share the bold aspirations of the Avengers, they ragtag kids currently lack the capacity to function on their level. The New Warriors are composed of six young heroes.

Doreen Green, who fans will recognize as Squirrel Girl, will join the team in her live-action debut. While her squirrel-themed skill set may seem innocent, she’s portrayed in the comics as one of Marvel’s most capable heroes, even defeating the likes of Dr. Doom.

Additional details will come later, including casting decisions and which characters will join the roster alongside Squirrel Girl. Marvel’s Jeph Loeb and Jim Chory will work on Marvel’s New Warriors as executive producers. Loeb, the head of Marvel TV, is excited to expand his universe with the fan-favorite team:

    “Marvel’s New Warriors have always been fan favorites and now particularly with the addition of Squirrel Girl, they are Marvel Television favorites as well. After the amazing experience we’ve had with Freeform on Marvel’s Cloak & Dagger we can’t think of a better place for our young heroes.”
