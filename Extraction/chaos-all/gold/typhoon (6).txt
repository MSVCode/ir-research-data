Deadly Typhoon Lan slams Japan with damaging winds, flooding and mudslides

Rainfall totaling over 800 mm (31.50 inches) was reported in Wakayama Prefecture. Rainfall totals of around 200 mm (8 inches) were reported around Tokyo.

The Uda River overflowed its banks causing damage to several homes.

Several mudslides were also reported, damaging homes and halting travel in parts of Honshu.

The powerful cyclone brought winds as high as 170 km/h (106 mph) to Miyake Island, south of Tokyo.

Tokyo International airport reported a peak wind gust of 122 km/h (76 mph) while Osaka International Airport reached 132 km/h (82 mph).

Lan even brought snow to parts of Japan as flakes were reported all the way to sea level in parts of Hokkaido.

In 10-hour period on Monday, snowfall totaled 23 cm (9 inches) in Akan-kohan.

Lan has since transitioned into a non-tropical cyclone over the northwestern Pacific Ocean and will bring no further impacts to land.

While Lan is no longer a threat to Japan, a new tropical depression near the Mariana Islands could take a track similar to Lan and approach Japan this weekend.

This new threat is expected to be smaller and weaker than Lan but could still bring heavy rain and damaging winds to Japan as early as Saturday or Sunday.
