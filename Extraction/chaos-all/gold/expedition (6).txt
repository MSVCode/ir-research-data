Ocearch Shark Expedition In The Lowcountry

OCEARCH just concluded its 28th research expedition and 1st expedition in the lowcountry. The expedition took place February and March 2017 in waters off South Carolina and Georgia.

Great White Sharks an other large apex predators are the lifeblood of our oceans. That’s why Costa is a proud partner of OCEARCH, a group of explorers and scientists dedicated to generating previously unattainable data on the movement, biology and health of sharks. All while protecting their future and education the public. No one has ever attempted a program like this before. The information being collected is not only staggering, it’s helping protect these predators at the top of the marine food chain. As go the sharks, so go our oceans.
