Overwatch Uprising Skins Leaked Over Xbox Store 

Oops -- somebody at Xbox flipped a switch for the next Overwatch update a bit too quickly. Redditors caught on that the Xbox digital storefront showed off a bit more than Blizzard probably intended.

Like, say, what four of the upcoming skins look like.

From the looks of it, Mercy, Tracer, Torbjorn, and Reinhardt all get silver-and-blue Original Overwatch costumes, and thematically tied to the pre-existing Strike Commander Morrison skin for Soldier 76. Interestingly, Mercy has her hair down for this one as well.

The costume preview appears to accidentally replace the Overwatch: Origins logo, as seen here:

It seems unlikely that these will be the only skins for the upcoming Uprising event, of course. The comic that was released earlier this week suggested a plethora of options, including the skins now revealed -- and we still don't know what the expected new Widowmaker and McCree ones will look like.

There is as yet no formal announcement for when the new Overwatch event starts, though the next phase of material is expected for April 11.
