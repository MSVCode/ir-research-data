Original Green Ranger Actor Was Booted From 'Power Rangers' Premiere Screening

Even the most popular Power Ranger of all time couldn't get away with capturing video inside the "Power Rangers" movie premiere last week.

Jason David Frank, who played the original Green Ranger, told Hollywood Reporter he was booted from the screening for having his phone out.

"I'm the guy in the movie theater who wanted to get a reaction shot of the audience reacting to Amy and me when our cameo appeared," Frank said. "Right after our cameo appeared, I got escorted out by security because I had a camera in the movie." 

The decision cost him the opportunity to see the mid-credits scene teasing the arrival of the his old character, Angel Grove teenager Tommy Oliver, who gets a shoutout during roll call in detention.

"I didn't see the end of the movie," he said, "because security was arguing with me outside and I was trying to tell security, 'That's me in the movie!' And they said, 'I need your phone!' I'm like, 'You're not getting my phone!'"

Frank, who last appeared as the Green Ranger on TV in 2015's "Power Rangers Super Megaforce: The Legendary Battle," said he was "so upset" he missed the scene.

Sounds like he'll miss being the Green Ranger, too. When the actor was asked about the possibility of a female filling his shoes in the "Power Rangers" sequel, he said this: "I'm still Tommy for now! The Green Ranger is going to fill my shoes. But I still have my own shoes I'm wearing."

"The Green Ranger kicks butt," he said. "The Green Ranger has always been the most popular."
