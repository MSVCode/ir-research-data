Is Hugh Jackman Playing Himself In The Next Deadpool Movie?

Who needs Wolverine?

Hugh Jackman is riding a wave of praise after his brilliant performance in Marvel flick Logan, so what better time to play himself in a movie?

The teaser for Deadpool 2 aired before a screening of Logan and didn't give away much apart from a scene where Ryan Reynolds trash talks Logan and his tank top wearing in a fairly impressive Aussie accent.

Naturally this led fans to speculate over whether this meant Logan would be appearing in the new Deadpool film. Screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick were asked by The Hollywood Reporter if they should include Hugh Jackman as himself rather than try to force Wolverine into the plot.

"Oh my gosh, that's one we haven't heard," Reese said. "That's not a bad idea. I like that. Deadpool lives in a world where Hugh Jackman is out there. He's got the People's Sexiest Man Alive cover that he staples to his forehead in the first movie, so maybe he could meet Hugh as Hugh. That would be really funny."

We'll take that as confirmation then.
