SNL spoofs 'tone deaf' Kendall Jenner Pepsi ad

Saturday Night Live mocked the controversial Kendall Jenner Pepsi ad that the soft drink company pulled this week after receiving a torrent of online backlash.

In the sketch, the spot’s director (cast member Beck Bennett) discusses the commercial with his unseen sister while they speak on the phone.

“It’s an homage to the resistance. There’s this huge protest in the street, reminiscent of Black Lives Matter,” he says. “Everybody is marching and they get to these police officers and you think it’s going to go bad because there’s kind of a standoff. And then Kendall Jenner walks in. She walks up to one of the police officers and hands him a Pepsi. That Pepsi brings everyone together.”

After a pause, the director’s face drops as he listens to his sister criticize the premise. “Sort of tone deaf?” he repeats at one point. Later, other people get on the phone to explain why the commercial is such a bad idea.

The SNL sketch even featured cast member Cecily Strong as Jenner. “I stop the police from shooting black people by handing them a Pepsi. I know, it’s cute, right?” Strong as Jenner remarks.

Released this week, the Pepsi commercial featured the reality television star participating in a protest and handing a police officer a can of Pepsi in an effort to diffuse tension. The ad was blasted on social media after its release, prompting Pepsi to pull the spot a day later. “Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace, and understanding,” the company said in a statement. “Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologize. We did not intend to make light of any serious issue. We are removing the content and halting any further rollout. We also apologize for putting Kendall Jenner in this position.”
