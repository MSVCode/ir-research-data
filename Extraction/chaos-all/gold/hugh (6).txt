 Hugh Jackman dressed up as Wolverine for Halloween and only one person recognised him

But he reckons it's just because he had a cute kid with him.

Maybe this was why Hugh Jackman really decided to hang up his Wolverine claws.

Talking to The AP, Hugh revealed that he once dressed up as Logan for Halloween - but almost no one paid any attention.

"I dressed up once as Logan because my kid, my 3-year-old, went as Wolverine and the costume department gave him the full leather suit and the claws," Jackman recalled.

"I'd like to think it was because people were like, 'Awww, look at that kid' [but] only one of 50 houses actually recognised me. So I think I could roam the halls of Comic-Con and people would think, 'Too tall'."

Awkward.

Jackman's final outing as Wolverine, Logan, is currently in cinemas and he's recently spoken about not being initially keen on its ending.

Major SPOILERS follow after the photo if you haven't seen Logan yet.

Originally, Jackman wanted director James Mangold to take inspiration from Unforgiven as he thinks it's "more powerful" that Clint Eastwood's character doesn't die at the end of that movie.

But he came around to the idea that Logan had to die at the end: "Unlike a human character, what's most poignant for someone who is thought to be indestructible is him dying while saying, 'This is what it feels like'."
