Apple’s stock climbs to fifth record in March, 11th record this year

Shares of Apple Inc. surged to yet another record on Tuesday, after a UBS analyst said he could envision a scenario that would boost the stock by about 40% over the next few years.

The technology giant’s stock AAPL, +0.10%  ran up 2.1% to close at $143.80, which was 1.7% above the March 20 record close of $141.46. That marked the stock’s fifth record close this month and 11th record close this year.

The stock also surpassed the previous all-time intraday high of $142.80 reached on March 21.

UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said Apple’s stock price could rise to $200 in two to three years, but that would likely require continued iPhone growth beyond fiscal 2018, the establishment of new product categories and share buybacks of more than $50 billion a year.

Milunovich said his most-likely scenario would be for the stock to hit $175, which is 21% above current levels. That would require earnings continuing to rise, “but at a slowing rate,” as iPhone sales stop growing, new products have just moderate success and margins turn flat.

He also envisions a third scenario, in which the stock falls to $125, which is 14% below current levels. In that world, iPhone sales turn negative and material innovation proves difficult. Read more in Tuesday’s Need to Know column.

Apple’s stock has been on a tear since it reported blowout fiscal first-quarter results after the Jan. 31 close. Since then, the shares have run up 19%, while the SPDR Technology Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLK, +0.72%  has climbed 6.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.73%  has gained 4.2%.

The stock’s recent rally may also reflect investor confidence that President Donald Trump will follow through with his promise to cut corporate taxes enough to give companies an incentive to bring billions of dollars in profits parked overseas back to the U.S. That would allow Apple to boost shareholder returns, which could help support Milunovich’s case for a $200 stock price.

On Monday, the stock fell as much as 1.4% intraday, but bounced sharply to close up 0.2%, with J.P. Morgan raising its price target to $165 from $142. analyst Rod Hall said Apple will enjoy “high pent-up replacement demand” heading into the 10th anniversary iPhone cycle this year.
