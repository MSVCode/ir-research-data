Brandon Crawford scores winning run to send USA to WBC final

Brandon Crawford crossed the plate in the eighth inning Tuesday to give the United States the go-ahead run in an eventual 2-1 win over Japan to make the World Baseball Classic final.

Crawford and fellow Giants star Buster Posey each singled in the semifinal, plus Giants closer Mark Melancon made his WBC debut Tuesday as the U.S. reached the tournament’s final for the first time ever.

The United States will play Puerto Rico at 6 p.m. Wednesday, with MLB Network providing the coverage from Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.

Crawford’s one-out single to right field started an eighth-inning rally, with Ian Kinsler doubling and Adam Jones getting Crawford home with a ground out.

In the bottom half of the frame, Melancon entered with the 2-1 lead. He struck out one and allowed a hit and a walk over 2/3 innings of work.

Several Giants not playing took to Twitter immediately after the win to celebrate.
