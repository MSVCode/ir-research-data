Overwatch For Nintendo Switch Sounds Unlikely, But Not Ruled Out
Jeff Kaplan talks about why you shouldn't hold your breath for a Switch version.

Earlier this year, Overwatch game director Jeff Kaplan talked about the unlikely possibility of the hero shooter coming to Nintendo Switch. Now, Kaplan has said Blizzard would need to "revisit performance" to have Overwatch run the way Blizzard would want it to on Nintendo's hybrid console.

"I think the problem is, we've really targeted our min spec in a way that we would have to revisit performance and how to get on that platform," he told Express Online (via NeoGAF).

In addition to that, Kaplan said it's already no small task to support Overwatch on three platforms--PC, Xbox One, and PS4--so adding a fourth isn't something Blizzard could necessarily do right now.

The game director also talked about how he's happy that his team has been able to patch Overwatch on all systems at around the same time. Bringing on a new platform in the Nintendo Switch "would make that difficult," Express Online reported.

Overall, however, Kaplan doubled down on his earlier comment, saying Nintendo Switch remains a possibility for Overwatch sometime down the road.

"Just because we're not on a platform right now, it doesn't mean we won't reconsider it in the future, so we stay aware of all these things," he explained.
