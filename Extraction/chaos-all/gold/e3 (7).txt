Nintendo Teases A ‘Big E3’

It appears that Nintendo is going to have a lot to share with us in a few months as a company executive has said that Nintendo has a “Big E3” planned for its fans. Speaking with Fox News, Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime said that the company has big things to show at this year’s gaming convention.

“E3 is always a big time for Nintendo,” Fils-Aime said, adding that the company looks at each E3 as an opportunity to tell its story. “And we’re gonna have a big E3 this year. We’re going to be showcasing a variety of games,” he reiterated.

He didn’t go into the details about what Nintendo will be announcing at E3 2017 for obvious reasons but did mention that the company is going to showcase some Nintendo Switch and 3DS games at the event.

I’m not gonna tell you all of the various games and all of our little secrets for E3, but I can tell you that E3 is going to be a major opportunity for us to showcase not only Nintendo Switch, but also content coming to Nintendo 3DS,” he added.

Fans will obviously be very excited to see what Nintendo has in store for them. It’s even more exciting given that there hasn’t been a traditional E3 briefing from Nintendo for a few years as it has opted to conduct its Nintendo Direct presentations offsite.
