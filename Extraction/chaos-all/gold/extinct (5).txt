New search for the Tasmanian tiger

Recent Tasmania tiger "sightings" have prompted new scientific search for the species thought to be extinct.

It's been more than 80 years since thylacine, commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger, was last seen alive after the last one was believed to have died in a Hobart zoo in 1936, The Guardian reports.

Professor Bill Laurance and a team of scientists from James Cook University has launched a new search for the extinct marsupial after a string of recent sightings in Cape York Peninsula of a dog-like animal likened to thylacine.

The reported features on the animals were inconsistent with descriptions of dingos or foxes.

Sandra Abell, a researcher with James Cook University, said she had received more reported sightings since the study's initial report was made public.

"It is a low possibility that we’ll find thylacines, but we’ll certainly get lots of data on the predators in the area and that will help our studies in general," she said.

"It’s not a mythical creature. A lot of the descriptions people give, it’s not a glimpse in the car headlights. People who say they’ve actually seen them can describe them in great detail, so it’s hard to say they’ve seen anything else."
