Project Scorpio: Is The Xbox Console Ready For E3 Launch?

Project Scorpio, the newest gaming console for Xbox, is scheduled to arrive this holiday season. An executive from Xbox has said that it is vital for the Microsoft's first party games to be ready for the new system.

In his Twitter account, Xbox head Phil Spencer has said that the Project Scorpio would be critical. This is his response to someone when he asked if Scorpio would launch games.

Spencer might not exactly say that they are ready to release the Project Scorpio. It could also mean that he is referring to the games being updated in order to support the new system.

GameSpot has reported that it actually makes sense if the Microsoft would want to have their first-party games updated for the Project Scorpio. It makes more sense, the publication wrote, given it is now the platform-holder.

Spencer also added on how he and the company are mainly focused on the first-party games of Project Scorpio. He said that they will be careful about it when they announce things, knowing a strong 1P is critical.

The Project Scorpio was announced through a trailer that was aired last summer 2016. It shows developers from big-time studios like Electronic Arts, giving hints that the game could be from those teams who would update the Project Scorpio.

Project Scorpio will also support the user's existing controllers and accessories. This is an addition to all the Xbox One games that would be covered.

The price of the Project Scorpio was reported to be at $300 since they claimed that it is a premium device that would be more expensive than Xbox One S. However, Spencer said that the Project Scorpio would not be sold the same as the Xbox One S.

The Project Scorpio could also be slated to be discussed at an event before E3 would discuss the console. A product page the console is already uploaded on the Mircosoft store, although the preorder option is not yet available.
