Robot pizza deliveries from Domino’s are coming to Europe

Domino’s is going to start delivering pizzas using a robot.

But it’s not one of those super looking drones that companies like Amazon are developing.

This one is a simple design that travels at just 4mph on the ground, which means it might actually work as there’s less that can go wrong.

Domino’s has partnered up with Estonia’s Starship Technologies for the new venture that is expected to be launched in Hamburg, Germany, this summer.

If successful then one of the friendly looking androids could be visiting you in the UK very soon.

Domino’s CEO Don Meij said: ‘With our growth plans over the next five to 10 years, we simply won’t have enough delivery drivers if we do not look to add to our fleet through initiatives such as this.’

The electric powered robots can hold a maximum of five medium pizzas and orientate themselves by using on-board cameras, ultrasonic sensors and maps.

They can also navigate all types of terrain but they have two major Achilles heels, they can’t climb stairs or go inside buildings.

In total five robots will deliver to homes that are up to one mile away from the store in Hamburg.

Customers can follow the progress of the robot’s delivery on their smartphones and will receive an unlock code to open it once it arrives.

Domino’s already has a similar delivery robot working in New Zealand.
