Texas baseball travels to San Marcos to face Texas State
The Bobcats just took two of three against the reigning national champions.

A rare midweek road trip for the Texas Longhorns will take head coach David Pierce’s team for a short drive down I-35 to San Marcos to play the Texas State Bobcats.

The ‘Horns lead the all-time series by a mark of 45-10, but had a 25-game winning streak against the Bobcats broken last season in Austin, one of the many disappointing losses

Sophomore left-hander Nick Kennedy is expected to take the mound for Texas as the team attempts to move past a weekend sweep at the hands of Texas Tech that featured a lack of notable lack of clutch hitting.

So far this season, Kennedy as been a revelation, as he’s posted a 3-0 record with a 0.75 ERA.

Texas State will counter with right-hander Cam Baird, who has struggled to an 0-2 record and 6.48 ERA, so this could be an opportunity for Texas to regain some confidence at the plate.

Here’s the starting lineup for the Longhorns:

Junior right fielder Patrick Mathis will miss another game due to his lower leg injury, while senior center fielder Zane Gurwitz continues to deal with his hamstring injury.

First pitch is at 6 p.m. CT on Spectrum Sports TV.
