 Original Power Ranger weighs in on the female Green Ranger debate

"No matter what, when you're in that spandex, and in that suit you are a superhero."

The Power Rangers reboot has been slaying box offices worldwide, but with six more films to come, everyone is just waiting for the appearance of the Green Ranger.

A post-credits scene from the movie seemed to confirm the Green Ranger (previously known as Tommy Oliver) would be cropping up in up the next film, but the mystery behind who will put on the suit is yet to come.

With lobbyists - and even the cast - calling for a female to step up and take on the role - what does original Green Ranger Jason David Frank think?

"I'm still Tommy for now!" he told The Hollywood Reporter.

"The Green Ranger is going to fill my shoes. But I still have my own shoes I'm wearing.

"The Green Ranger kicks butt. The Green Ranger has always been the most popular."

"No matter what [series creator] Haim Saban does, people are going to love it. He would not allow something that fans will not like," David Frank added.

"After watching the movie, anything is possible. It doesn't matter what colour your skin is. It doesn't matter if you're female or you're male.

"No matter what, when you're in that spandex, and in that suit you are a superhero."

Power Rangers is in cinemas now.
