Former NASA astronaut and Flagstaff resident has died

A former NASA astronaut who lived in Flagstaff after retiring, has died. Paul Weitz, 85, was also a deputy director of the Johnson Space Center and served as a pilot on the first manned Skylab mission in 1973.

A decade later, Weitz was the spacecraft commander of the maiden voyage of the Orbiter Challenger. During the 1983 mission, the crew conducted numerous experiments in materials processing, recorded lightning activities and conducted spectacular extravehicular activity while testing a variety of support systems and equipment in preparation for future space walks, according to Weitz's biography page on NASA's website.

By the end of that trip, Weitz had logged more than a month in space on NASA missions. 

Weitz moved to Flagstaff after retiring from the deputy director position at NASA's Johnson Space Center in May 1994.

A spokesman from NASA could not confirm where Weitz was living at the time of his death, though Weitz's hometown newspaper in Erie, Penn., said he was living in Flagstaff at the time of his death.
