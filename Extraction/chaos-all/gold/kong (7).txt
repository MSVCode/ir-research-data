Box Office: 'Beauty' Can't Slay 'Kong' As Logan' And 'Get Out' Survive 'The Beast'

Once again, Kong: Skull Island has a slightly rosier picture on Sunday morning than it did on Saturday morning. The $185 million-budgeted monster mash earned a solid $28.9 million on its second weekend, dropping just 53% from last weekend's $61m debut. Of note, the film made more on Sunday ($9.2m) than it did on Friday ($7.3m) along with a $12m Saturday, showing that the film is playing well to kids in the matinee hours. If that's true, then Spring Break should prove as much a boon (relatively speaking) for Kong as for Walt Disney's Beauty and the Beast. Nonetheless, the film has earned a solid $110m 10-day gross.

Comparatively speaking, Godzilla dropped 66% in its second weekend and Roland Emmerich's Godzilla dropped 59% back in 1998.  Even Peter Jackson's King Kong dropped 57% over Christmas weekend back in 2005. If Skull Island merely plays like Gareth Edwards' Godzilla or Roland Emmerich's Godzilla from here on out, and that's a pessimistic outlook, it still gets to over/under $150m domestic by the end. But Peter Jackson's King Kong had $108m by the end of its second weekend. That's apples and oranges for a number of reasons (the Christmas holiday, the fact that Jackson's Kong opened on a Wednesday, etc.), but I am impressed by Skull Island's staying power against this kind of competition. Neither airplanes nor beauty can kill this beast.

With a whopping $149 million overseas cume and a $259m global total, neither airplanes nor beauty can kill this beast.

Speaking of unkillable beasts, Logan held tough against its monstrous competition as well. The 20th Century Fox X-Men spin-off earned $17.5 million on its third weekend, dropping 54% and bringing its domestic cume up to $184m. It's currently the year's biggest domestic and global grosser, but that won't last terribly long. Nonetheless, the R-rated Hugh Jackman vehicle is a huge hit and a shot in the arm for Fox's "blockbusters for adults" strategy. it is already the fourth-biggest X-Men movie of all time in North America and will soon surpass (if it hasn't already) the $544m global cume of X-Men: Apocalypse to be the third-biggest X-Men movie.
