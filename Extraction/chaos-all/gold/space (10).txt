Trump, Cruz joke about sending lawmakers into space

President Trump joked Tuesday that it would be a “great idea” to send Congress on an intergalactic — and perhaps one-way — journey into space.

Trump signed a bill Tuesday in the Oval Office that authorized funding for NASA. Flanked by the bill’s co-authors, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), the legislation asks NASA to send a “crewed mission to Mars in the 2030s.”

The president — who earlier Tuesday pressed Republicans at a closed-door meeting at the Capitol to pass the GOP's ObamaCare repeal bill — praised the nation’s “heroic astronauts,” before noting the difficulty of the profession.

"It's a pretty tough job," Trump said, according to a White House pool report. He then turned to his former Republican presidential primary opponents and inquired, “I don’t know, Ted, would you like to do it? I don’t think I would.”

Cruz shook his head to express an unwillingness to slip on a space suit.

“Marco, do you want to do it?” Trump then asked Rubio.

“I’m not sure we want to do it,” the president concluded.

But then Cruz offered up some perhaps unwilling space-traveling volunteers.

“You could send Congress to space,” he suggested.

"We could," Trump, who's clashed with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle before, said to laughs as he turned towards Vice President Pence. "What a great idea that could be."
