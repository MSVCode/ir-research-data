Is Elon Musk overly fixated on going to Mars? Richard Branson thinks so

The Virgin founder believes that we should be concentrating on fixing Earth up

 It’s no secret that Elon Musk loves Mars. He’s in such a hurry to leave Earth that it sometimes feels like he’s given up on our rapidly warming planet. But his commercial rival, Richard Branson, has his heart resting a little closer to home, and on Wednesday the billionaire took the time to urge Musk to come back down to Earth – firing criticisms at his plans for interplanetary colonisation at a time when we have big problems down here.

“Elon is absolutely fixated on going to Mars and I think it’s his life mission,” Branson said on the show Squawk Box. “Jeff [Bezos - who spends $1bn per year on Amazon’s Blue Origin rocket] and ourselves at the Virgin Group are more interested in how we use space to benefit the Earth.”

He then urged Musk to help the Earth rather than leaving it in the dust.

“I think space needs a lot of companies doing a lot of different things to benefit the Earth back here,” Branson added.

He pointed out some of the ways that commercial space exploration could be used to benefit the environment like releasing a fleet of satellites that would monitor everything from global methane levels to illegal fishing.
