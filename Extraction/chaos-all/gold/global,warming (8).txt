Scary interactive map shows how water levels will rise due to global warming

Have you ever wondered how global warming is slowly but gradually changing everything around us? Now there’s a nifty interactive map that will help you easily put things into perspective – or at least give you a better idea.

In an effort to raise awareness of the detrimental impact of global warming, National Geographic has put up a neat interactive map that shows how the rise of global temperature is causing sea levels across the globe to elevate at worrying rates – and how things are bound to get even worse in the future.

You can find the visualization on the website of its environmental documentary Before the Flood, which debuted a few months back in October. Hosted by Hollywood favorite Leonardo DiCaprio, the eco-flick features interviews from notable public figures like former US president Barack Obama and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Here’s a glimpse of the map in action:

“Every fraction of a degree of global warming sets in motion sea level rise that will profoundly threaten coastal cities across the world,” explains Dr. Benjamin Strauss from Climate Central. “[Our map] shows the incredible stakes and urgency of our climate choices.”

In addition to its visualization on the rising sea levels, the website further links to a few other interactive presentations and resources on our swiftly deteriorating environment, including this global flood analyzing tool as well as a summary of all the negative manifestations of global warming.
