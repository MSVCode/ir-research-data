 The original Green Ranger was kicked out of the Power Rangers premiere

No no, Power Ranger... ?

Eagle-eyed fans of the original Power Rangers series will have noticed a familiar cameo or two in the new movie.

One of them was the guy who played the first Green Ranger, Jason David Frank, who popped up alongside original Pink Ranger Amy Jo Johnson.

It was this cameo that actually got Frank kicked out of the Power Rangers premiere.

Frank explained to The Hollywood Reporter that he wanted to take a snap of the audience during his big moment.

"I'm the guy in the movie theatre who wanted to get a reaction shot of the audience reacting to Amy and me when our cameo appeared," he said.

"Right after our cameo appeared, I got escorted out by security because I had a camera in the movie. I didn't see the end of the movie, because security was arguing with me outside and I was trying to tell security, 'That's me in the movie!'

"They said, 'I need your phone!' I'm like, 'You're not getting my phone!'"

His abrupt exit from the premiere also meant that he missed the mid-credits scene.

The sequence – spoilers! – teased the arrival of the Green Ranger when the gang find themselves in detention. The teacher calls out the name "Tommy Oliver" with no luck as the camera focuses on an empty desk with a green jacket on it.

Frank said: "I didn't get to see the end of the movie when they called Tommy. I was so upset."

Power Rangers is now out in cinemas.
