 STORAGE HUNTERS How to free up iPhone storage by installing Apple’s latest iOS update

The tech giant's latest operating system update also lets users track down their lost AirPods

IPHONE users will be able to free up some precious space on their smartphone when they install Apple’s latest operating system update.

The new iOS10.3 update features a new file system – named Apple File System (APFS) – which will replace the existing HFS+ file system and will automatically free up space on your device.

The APFS has been called the “the next generation in storage” and will is available on iPhone, iPad or IPod touch, reports the Verge.

The high-tech new file system will support features like snapshot and will boost encryption, reports the Express.

APFS will free up space due to the way it processes data on your device.

Installing the update is easy and can be done by following Settings > General > Software Update.

The update’s other useful features include being able to track Apple’s controversial AirPods.

The wireless earbuds were introduced by the tech giant with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ which discarded the handy headphone jack.

Users will now be able to locate their lost earbuds by using the Find My iPhone app which enables you to play a sound from them.

And if you’re too far away from the earphones to hear the sound, you can also see the location where they were last connected to your iOS through Bluetooth.
