Typhoon No. 21 kills 6 across Japan, 12 more seriously injured

At least six people were killed across the nation by powerful Typhoon No. 21, which wreaked havoc with record rainfall.

Landslides and other disasters unfolded across the country, with the six deaths occurring in Fukuoka city and Osaka, Wakayama and Mie prefectures, including a case of a man who died after a landslide poured into his house.

The Fire and Disaster Management Agency of the internal affairs ministry said that as of Oct. 23, 12 people had been seriously injured and 85 others had sustained minor injuries across Japan. Fifty houses were partially destroyed.

Shingu, Wakayama Prefecture, was deluged with 888.5 millimeters of rain in a 48-hour period through around midnight on Oct. 22, breaking all records.

Many parts of Wakayama and Mie Prefecture received 600 to 700 mm of rain in a 48-hour period.

On the morning of Oct. 23, torrential rain removed plaster and clay from a 17-meter-wide section of the outer wall at Hikone Castle, a designated national treasure, in Hikone, Shiga Prefecture.

The powerful typhoon made landfall around Omaezaki, Shizuoka Prefecture, early on Oct. 23 before heading north over Japan.

It traveled through the main island of Honshu that afternoon before reaching the eastern sea off Hokkaido, losing strength and becoming an extratropical cyclone.

The typhoon and active front caused continuous downpours starting on Oct. 21, building up to the unprecedented rainfall in the wider area by Oct. 23.
