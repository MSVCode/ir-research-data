(And, increasingly, the real one, too, for that matter.) Not too long ago, the predominant question was <em>Should I buy the new iPhone?</em> Then it became <em>Do I need to be on Twitter?</em> or <em>Do I need to be on Facebook?</em> or <em>Do I need to be on Snapchat?</em> (That question has since come full circle to <em>Should I quit Twitter and Facebook?</em>) These days, the question I hear the most&#x2014;well, besides whether Twitter should ban Trump&#x2014;is <em>Should I buy bitcoin?</em></p><p data-reactid="216">I usually respond with the story of <strong>Laszlo Hanyecz.</strong> If you&#x2019;ve come within <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2013/04/logic-problems-bitcoin-bubble">500 feet of bitcoin</a>, or any other cryptocurrency, over the past few years, the name alone will make you cringe. Back in 2010, when the currency was in its infancy, Hanyecz went &#x201C;mining&#x201D; for bitcoins for a few months and collected 10,000 of them; he subsequently traded them, in what would be the first cryptocurrency transaction in history, to a guy who bought him two Papa John&#x2019;s pizzas with a couple sides of that tasty, buttery garlic sauce. Back then, Hanyecz&#x2019;s bitcoins had no value, and the $30 value of two pies and an accoutrement made his individual bitcoin units worth 0.003 cents apiece. Today, at their current market valuation, bitcoin units are worth around $5,800 each, which means Hanyecz&#x2019;s 10,000 bitcoins would be worth around $58 million. &#x201C;It wasn&#x2019;t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,&#x201D; Hanyecz <a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/disruptions-betting-on-bitcoin/">told me</a> in 2013, when bitcoin was already valued at $1,242 each. &#x201C;No one knew it was going to get so big.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="217">For a lot of people on the periphery of this technology, the extraordinary rise in bitcoin&#x2019;s value has become cause for alarm. The Web is littered with news articles, blog posts, and white papers warning that bitcoin and its sibling currencies are worth nothing, and the rise and fall of the currencies&#x2019; worth, which can fluctuate by billions of dollars a minute, certainly backs that up. But while <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/jamie-dimon#intcid=dt-hot-link">Jamie Dimon</a></strong> and other bankers might <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/should-jamie-dimon-be-terrified-about-bitcoin">scoff</a> at these digital currencies, Silicon Valley is extremely bullish. There&#x2019;s a reason, too: if <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/jamie-dimon-billion-dollar-secret-jp-morgan">Dimon had invested</a> in bitcoin when he first called it a joke, in 2015, he would have received a tenfold return on his investment.</p></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="218"><p data-reactid="219">There are a number of reasons why bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are doing so well right now. One of the more plausible scenarios was outlined this week in a very clever <a href="https://blog.chain.com/a-letter-to-jamie-dimon-de89d417cb80">post</a> written by <strong>Adam Ludwin,</strong> an investor and co-founder of Chain.com, a bitcoin developer platform, which argues that bitcoin is an entirely new asset class, similar to equities and bonds, and that &#x201C;bitcoin is capitalism, distilled.&#x201D; The &#x201C;capitalism&#x201D; part of the sentence helps explain why some in Silicon Valley are so specifically exuberant about it right now. &#x201C;In the short-run, there will be extreme volatility as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO</a> competes with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">FUD</a>, confusion competes with understanding, and greed competes with fear (on both the buyer side and the issuer side),&#x201D; Ludwin wrote. &#x201C;Most people buying into crypto assets have checked their judgement at the door.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="220">This gets someone like me a bit nervous about what cryptocurrencies could end up doing to society in the long run. Silicon Valley culture is largely fueled by people who love to decimate industries that don&#x2019;t work, often without any thought of how the disruption could lead to other negative results happening in society (see the recent social-media debacle around the election ). In typical Valley fantasy, people are seeing only the positive potential with bitcoin, not the potentially ugly outcomes when humans molest it for their own interests.</p><div data-reactid="221"><div class="embed cneembed"><div class="embed block cneembed" data-url="//player.cnevids.com/script/video/59e760be148bb009b9000001.js?muted=1"></div></div></div><p data-reactid="222">One of the many factors currently fueling the ascent of bitcoin is the rise of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/business/dealbook/initial-coin-offerings-sec-virtual-currency.html">initial coin offerings</a>, or I.C.O.s, where some lucky investors are reaping astounding returns. You can think of these like a traditional initial public offering, or I.P.O., but without the layers upon layers of regulation and government bureaucracy that come with a company going public. With an I.C.O., a start-up raises money for a new venture by selling &#x201C;coins&#x201D; that are very similar to shares of a public company. The coins then rise and fall as the company&#x2019;s value oscillates. In 2014, when the founding of a new cryptocurrency called Ethereum was announced, it raised $18 million by selling a new digital coin called &#x201C;Ether&#x201D; for 40 cents per coin. Today, Ethereum has a market cap of around $30 billion. So if you had spent $100 on Ether during the I.C.O., you would have made $74,900 in profit. As <strong>Nathaniel Popper</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/business/dealbook/coin-digital-currency.html?_r=0">detailed</a> in <em>The New York Times</em> earlier this summer, I.C.O.s have been generating billions of dollars in returns for some&#x2014;and a lot of scams, too.</p><p data-reactid="223">The lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency world, after all, means that there is a lot of fraud, extreme volatility, and coin values can jump up or down in mere seconds. Someone I recently spoke with who works with, and monitors, the crypto I.C.O. markets pointed out that some of these I.C.O.s feel awfully similar to the Dot Com public offerings of the late 90s, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/08/is-silicon-valley-in-another-bubble">where the public was buying into nothing</a> and ended up with exactly that when the entire market came crashing down and trillions of dollars were wiped off the stock market. In China, I.C.O.s became so troubling that they were banned earlier this year. In September, the People&#x2019;s Bank of China issued a blunt statement <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-ico-ban-understandable-reasonable-probably-temporary/">saying that this practice was</a> &#x201C;illegal and disruptive to economic and financial stability.&#x201D; I.C.O.s in China were occurring at an astounding rate, with one report claiming that more than $750 million was raised in I.C.O.s in July and August alone. A lot of people think the ban by China is temporary, slowing the dizzying speed of these offerings.</p><p data-reactid="224">As a result of all the movement in the cryptocurrency market over the past couple of years, there are a lot of options out there for people who want to try their hand in crypto-investing. There&#x2019;s bitcoin, the first and most well known of all the currencies, which currently oscillates in value at around $5,000 a coin. I&#x2019;ve heard predictions all over the map, from bitcoins one day being worth as much as $500,000 each to units being worth absolutely nothing if a better coin comes along. (My personal prediction is that they will continue to rise for at least the next couple of years.) Ether had remained relatively flat until earlier this year when it spiked in value to over $350 apiece. (It&#x2019;s since fallen to $300 each.) The current coin du jour is called Litecoin, which is getting a lot of attention because it&#x2019;s still priced relatively low, at around $55 each, and is expected to rise considerably over the next year or so on account of new features that will be added to enable more privacy options. Then there are a slew of other coins to explore, including Monero, which is an open-source currency that was developed in April 2014, but which spiked this year after the illegal drug market AlphaBay was taken down. Monero, unlike other currencies, is truly anonymous, making it the perfect currency with which to buy and sell drugs, guns, and other illegal contraband on the Dark Web. If you look at <a href="https://www.worldcoinindex.com/">the World Coin Index</a> Web site, you can see a long list of other coins and their values over time, including Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Qtum, NEO, Nav Coin, NEM, and a number of other coins.</p><p data-reactid="225">For Silicon Valley, betting on one of these early can mean profiting beyond all imagination, exceeding even the famed 1,000x start-up returns from companies like Facebook and Uber. Earlier this summer, I <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/exclusive-the-winklevoss-twins-are-so-over-facebook">interviewed</a> <strong>Tyler</strong> and <strong>Cameron Winklevoss,</strong> the twins who co-founded The Facebook with <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/mark-zuckerberg#intcid=dt-hot-link">Mark Zuckerberg</a>,</strong> and they are now obsessively investing in cryptocurrencies. In a settlement with Facebook, the two brothers were awarded $60 million, but to hear them talk about it, it appears their investments in bitcoin and other currencies are going to reap a far bigger return over time. I&#x2019;ve spoken with countless other people about the current state of bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and I&#x2019;ve heard two truths that seems consistent. No one&#x2014;and I mean no one&#x2014;knows exactly which digital currency will be successful in the future. It could be bitcoin, it could be Litecoin, it could be something that hasn&#x2019;t even been created yet. But, the other resounding feeling is that these currencies are here to stay in one form or another and there is nothing anyone can do to stop them. Which brings me back to that question that I&#x2019;m often asked these days: &#x201C;should I buy bitcoin?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="226">There&#x2019;s an old saying in real estate that &#x201C;you shouldn&#x2019;t wait to buy, but rather you should buy and then wait.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s the way I feel about these cryptocurrencies. If you&#x2019;re looking for a quick and dramatic financial boost, realize that you could probably get similar odds by buying a plane ticket to Las Vegas, walking into the first casino you see, and putting all your money on black or red. But, if you&#x2019;re willing to wait it out, there&#x2019;s a chance that your investment in a cryptocurrency could make for an impressive return over time. Just be prepared to go it the long haul. Or at least until the price spikes tomorrow.</p><div class="mvt-variant" style="min-width:1px;min-height:1px;" data-cn-variation="8550255229" data-cn-test="8546053398" data-reactid="227"><div

Back in 2010, when the currency was in its infancy, Hanyecz went &#x201C;mining&#x201D; for bitcoins for a few months and collected 10,000 of them; he subsequently traded them, in what would be the first cryptocurrency transaction in history, to a guy who bought him two Papa John&#x2019;s pizzas with a couple sides of that tasty, buttery garlic sauce. Back then, Hanyecz&#x2019;s bitcoins had no value, and the $30 value of two pies and an accoutrement made his individual bitcoin units worth 0.003 cents apiece. Today, at their current market valuation, bitcoin units are worth around $5,800 each, which means Hanyecz&#x2019;s 10,000 bitcoins would be worth around $58 million. &#x201C;It wasn&#x2019;t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,&#x201D; Hanyecz <a href=\"https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/disruptions-betting-on-bitcoin/\">told me</a> in 2013, when bitcoin was already valued at $1,242 each. &#x201C;No one knew it was going to get so big.&#x201D;</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>For a lot of people on the periphery of this technology, the extraordinary rise in bitcoin&#x2019;s value has become cause for alarm.

You can think of these like a traditional initial public offering, or I.P.O., but without the layers upon layers of regulation and government bureaucracy that come with a company going public. With an I.C.O., a start-up raises money for a new venture by selling &#x201C;coins&#x201D; that are very similar to shares of a public company. The coins then rise and fall as the company&#x2019;s value oscillates. In 2014, when the founding of a new cryptocurrency called Ethereum was announced, it raised $18 million by selling a new digital coin called &#x201C;Ether&#x201D; for 40 cents per coin. Today, Ethereum has a market cap of around $30 billion. So if you had spent $100 on Ether during the I.C.O., you would have made $74,900 in profit. As <strong>Nathaniel Popper</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/business/dealbook/coin-digital-currency.html?_r=0\">detailed</a> in <em>The New York Times</em> earlier this summer, I.C.O.s have been generating billions of dollars in returns for some&#x2014;and a lot of scams, too.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>The lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency world, after all, means that there is a lot of fraud, extreme volatility, and coin values can jump up or down in mere seconds. Someone I recently spoke with who works with, and monitors, the crypto I.C.O. markets pointed out that some of these I.C.O.s feel awfully similar to the Dot Com public offerings of the late 90s, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/08/is-silicon-valley-in-another-bubble\">where the public was buying into nothing</a> and ended up with exactly that when the entire market came crashing down and trillions of dollars were wiped off the stock market. In China, I.C.O.s became so troubling that they were banned earlier this year. In September, the People&#x2019;s Bank of China issued a blunt statement <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-ico-ban-understandable-reasonable-probably-temporary/\">saying that this practice was</a> &#x201C;illegal and disruptive to economic and financial stability.&#x201D; I.C.O.s in China were occurring at an astounding rate, with one report claiming that more than $750 million was raised in I.C.O.s in July and August alone. A lot of people think the ban by China is temporary, slowing the dizzying speed of these offerings.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>As a result of all the movement in the cryptocurrency market over the past couple of years, there are a lot of options out there for people who want to try their hand in crypto-investing. There&#x2019;s bitcoin, the first and most well known of all the currencies, which currently oscillates in value at around $5,000 a coin. I&#x2019;ve heard predictions all over the map, from bitcoins one day being worth as much as $500,000 each to units being worth absolutely nothing if a better coin comes along. (My personal prediction is that they will continue to rise for at least the next couple of years.) Ether had remained relatively flat until earlier this year when it spiked in value to over $350 apiece. (It&#x2019;s since fallen to $300 each.) The current coin du jour is called Litecoin, which is getting a lot of attention because it&#x2019;s still priced relatively low, at around $55 each, and is expected to rise considerably over the next year or so on account of new features that will be added to enable more privacy options. Then there are a slew of other coins to explore, including Monero, which is an open-source currency that was developed in April 2014, but which spiked this year after the illegal drug market AlphaBay was taken down. Monero, unlike other currencies, is truly anonymous, making it the perfect currency with which to buy and sell drugs, guns, and other illegal contraband on the Dark Web. If you look at <a href=\"https://www.worldcoinindex.com/\">the World Coin Index</a> Web site, you can see a long list of other coins and their values over time, including Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Qtum, NEO, Nav Coin, NEM, and a number of other coins.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>For Silicon Valley, betting on one of these early can mean profiting beyond all imagination, exceeding even the famed 1,000x start-up returns from companies like Facebook and Uber. Earlier this summer, I <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/exclusive-the-winklevoss-twins-are-so-over-facebook\">interviewed</a> <strong>Tyler</strong> and <strong>Cameron Winklevoss,</strong> the twins who co-founded The Facebook with <strong><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/people/mark-zuckerberg#intcid=dt-hot-link\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>,</strong> and they are now obsessively investing in cryptocurrencies. In a settlement with Facebook, the two brothers were awarded $60 million, but to hear them talk about it, it appears their investments in bitcoin and other currencies are going to reap a far bigger return over time. I&#x2019;ve spoken with countless other people about the current state of bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and I&#x2019;ve heard two truths that seems consistent. No one&#x2014;and I mean no one&#x2014;knows exactly which digital currency will be successful in the future. It could be bitcoin, it could be Litecoin, it could be something that hasn&#x2019;t even been created yet. But, the other resounding feeling is that these currencies are here to stay in one form or another and there is nothing anyone can do to stop them. Which brings me back to that question that I&#x2019;m often asked these days: &#x201C;should I buy bitcoin?&#x201D;</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>There&#x2019;s an old saying in real estate that &#x201C;you shouldn&#x2019;t wait to buy, but rather you should buy and then wait.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s the way I feel about these cryptocurrencies. If you&#x2019;re looking for a quick and dramatic financial boost, realize that you could probably get similar odds by buying a plane ticket to Las Vegas, walking into the first casino you see, and putting all your money on black or red. But, if you&#x2019;re willing to wait it out, there&#x2019;s a chance that your investment in a cryptocurrency could make for an impressive return over time. Just be prepared to go it the long haul.

As head of J.P.Morgan Chase, Dimon hadn’t let his firm take on the same level of exposure to subprime mortgages and collateralized debt obligations as virtually every other firm had. This allowed Dimon to sweep in as both the de facto critic of the industry and its savior. He scooped up Bear Sterns and took over Washington Mutual, saving some 30,000 jobs in the process.\n<p>In some ways, Dimon was destined to fill this seat. Born in Queens to a stockbroker father (and stockbrother grandfathers before him), Dimon and his twin brother studied at Tufts University before Jamie went on to Harvard Business School, where he palled around with Steve Burke and Jeffrey Immelt. Years later, Francis Ford Coppola would call him to have lunch, and he thought it was Burke playing a joke on him. (It was, in fact, Coppola, and the two had a three-hour lunch during which <em>The Godfather</em> director told him he was interested in basing a character on him).</p>\n<p>But when you’re Wall Street’s golden boy, it stings extra when the narrative shifts in the other direction, as it did in 2012 when the “London Whale” cost JPMorgan at least $6 billion in trading losses for a series of huge, embarrassingly risky bets that called the bank’s management into question. “We have egg on our face. We deserve any criticism we get,” Dimon told analysts and the media in a conference call soon after.</p>\n<p>The trading losses were just part of the criticism Dimon and the bank had to field. There was also the $13-billion settlement with federal and state agencies in 2013 over its pre-crisis mortgage practices. And then there was the Dimon family Christmas card in which the executive, his wife, three daughters, and one son-in-law were seen trashing a pristine penthouse with tennis rackets and balls in an artfully-done panoramic shot. After 10 years at the bank, Dimon, who battled throat cancer in 2014, is still one of the most active, and handsomely paid executives on Wall Street. As his bank’s stock struggled in a volatile market in early 2016, he invested $26.6 million of his own fortune into the company&#8212;a vote of confidence when shareholders needed it.

Bitcoin is “a fraud” that will eventually blow up, Dimon fumed last month at the Delivering Alpha conference. “It’s not a real thing, eventually it will be closed. It’s worse than tulip bulbs,” he said, referencing the tulip bubble that struck Holland during the Dutch Golden Age. “It won’t end well. Someone is going to get killed.” Any JPMorgan trader he caught trading bitcoin could expect to be “fire[d] in a second,” he warned. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/13/bitcoin-fraud-jp-morgan-cryptocurrency-drug-dealers\">He added</a> that the only people he would expect to be using the digital currency are drug dealers and murderers.</p>\n<p>Dimon doesn’t seem to have a problem with the blockchain technology that makes bitcoin work: JPMorgan was a “<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/10/04/jp-morgan-chase-blockchain-ethereum-quorum/\">founding member</a>” of another cryptocurrency initiative, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, and created its own cryptocurrency product, Quorum. But unlike other well-known figures on Wall Street who have begun to embrace bitcoin itself&#8212;like <strong>Bill Miller,</strong> whose top holdings are said to include the digital currency, and Fundstrat’s <strong>Tom Lee,</strong> who spent 15 years at JPMorgan and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/18/tom-lee-sees-bitcoin-jumping-to-6000-next-year.html\">said</a> he sees bitcoin hitting $6,000 by next year and $25,000 by 2022&#8212;Dimon thinks bitcoin is a scam. While JPMorgan trades bitcoin for clients, the bank <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2017/09/18/jpmorgan-is-trading-bitcoin-despite-dimon-calling-it-a-fraud/\">notes</a> that “they are not JPMorgan orders. These are clients purchasing third-party products directly.”</p>\n<p>And when you’re a boomer dad like Dimon&#8212;who has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/13/jamie-dimon-says-people-who-buy-bitcoin-are-stupid.html\">joked</a> about his “formerly smart daughter” who apparently owns two bitcoins&#8212;you don’t just change your convictions because something is suddenly popular or because millennials tell you to. Which is apparently why, despite <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/12/jamie-dimon-says-hes-not-going-to-talk-about-bitcoin-anymore.html\">declaring just yesterday</a> that he was “not going to talk about bitcoin anymore,” Dimon <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/13/jamie-dimon-says-people-who-buy-bitcoin-are-stupid.html\">couldn’t help but comment on Friday</a>, in response to a question at the Institute of International Finance’s conference, that anyone who buys bitcoin is an idiot in for a fall.</p>\n<p>“I could care less about bitcoin,” Dimon told the audience. “The blockchain is a technology which is a good technology. We actually use it. . . . Gold bless the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies, digital currencies, I think are also fine. JPMorgan moves $16 trillion around the world every day, we don’t do it in cash, it’s done digitally. If it can be done digitally with the blockchain, so be it. But it will still be a dollar cryptocurrency.”</p>\n<p>“What I have an issue with is a non-fiat cryptocurrency,” he continued. “I don’t personally understand the value of something that has no actual value. You all can do whatever you want and I don’t care. I could care less what bitcoin trades for, how it trades, why it trades, who trades it. If you’re stupid enough to buy it, you’ll pay the price for it one day. . . . The only value of bitcoin is what the other guy will pay for it.”</p>\n<p>In an interview with Bloomberg, financier <strong>Mike Novogratz</strong>, who has raised $500 million to start a hedge fund that will invest in cryptocurrencies, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-13/-rent-taker-dimon-will-lose-in-cryptorevolution-novogratz-says\">said</a> “Jamie Dimon gets paid to worry about bitcoin because he’s a rent-taker. The decentralized revolution is about going after the rent-takers. His bank is in the crosshairs of the cryptorevolution. So he’s playing defense. He’s going to lose.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Gary Cohn is basically being held at the White House against his will</strong></p>\n<p>Why has the former Goldman Sachs president chosen to stick around in the train wreck that is the Trump administration, despite his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-confronts-unprecedented-public-rebuke-by-gary-cohn-after-charlottsville/2017/08/25/d5ec8488-89b3-11e7-961d-2f373b3977ee_story.html?utm_term=.16f672eced12\">evident displeasure</a> about his boss basically going to bat for neo-Nazis and white supremacists? According to my colleague <strong>William Cohan,</strong> it’s because Trump <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/gary-cohn-cant-quit-trump?mbid=social_twitter\">refuses to let him quit</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He eventually got an audience with the president. They talked about Trump’s upsetting response to Charlottesville. Trump told him, “Is it really so bad?” according to the same person familiar with what transpired. Cohn conveyed to Trump how upset he was and that he wanted to resign. He unburdened himself to Trump. Trump told him to “think about it” and not to act rashly. Cohn emerged from the encounter with second thoughts. “I’ve been asked to think about it,” he said, according to the source. That night, Cohn headed to his house in the Hamptons and to a 30-person dinner party, where he arrived two hours late, at the home of <strong>Lloyd Blankfein,</strong> the C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs and his former boss. Over the weekend, he spoke to his wife and family, and others, about his concerns. His angst continued unabated. Cohn returned to Washington determined still to resign.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He asked Kelly for an appointment with Trump on August 21. But that was a tough day for Trump. The president was hunkered down, focused on the speech he was to give that night, in Arlington, Virginia, about the 16-year-old war in Afghanistan. Kelly told Cohn that his meeting with Trump would have to wait. Kelly offered Cohn the chance to see Trump, in the Oval Office, a day later, before Trump flew to Yuma, Arizona. Cohn accepted. This was Cohn’s showdown meeting with Trump. It was a “long conversation,” the source said, where Trump did everything from yelling at Cohn that his staying with him in the White House was a matter of his “national duty” to trying to cajole him into sticking it out, using more of a light touch. Interestingly, Trump was clear to make a distinction with Cohn. His “duty” was to “the country” not to Trump personally. He refused to read or to take Cohn’s letter of resignation. A White House official disputed that Trump specifically asked Cohn to stay on as national economic adviser. “The president encouraged Gary to make his own decision,” the official said. (For his part, Cohn declined to be interviewed about what happened.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jared Kushner can’t stop screwing up his disclosure forms</strong></p>\n<p>Jared Kushner, White House senior adviser and First Son-in-Law, whose agenda currently includes solving the opioid crisis, overhauling the government’s I.T. infrastructure, bringing peace to the Middle East, and “<a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/7-jobs-jared-kushner-is-now-doing-for-the-united-states-of-america-6f0a799462ed/\">reinventing the entire government</a>,” messed up another one of his forms again. Per <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/jared-kushner-ivanka-trump-white-house-forms-omissions-cadre-millions-679231\">*Newsweek</a>:*</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jared Kushner “enriched himself” by not revealing his ownership of a real estate tech business that raised millions of dollars while he served in the government, said a member of the House Judiciary Committee, calling it part of a pattern of unethical behavior that he believes should cause the White House Senior Adviser to be stripped of his security clearance. Congressman <strong>Ted Lieu</strong> told <em>Newsweek</em> that Kushner’s failure to list a company called Cadre on his initial financial disclosure forms&#8212;an oversight that could mean millions for the president’s son-in-law&#8212;is an ethical lapse that should have severe ramifications. “It appears [Kushner] ended up being the beneficiary of that omission,” said Lieu, a California Democrat. “He enriched himself by failing to disclose the asset.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Kushner’s lawyer, the failure to list Cadre was simply an “administrative error.” Previous “administrative errors” on Kushner’s part have included leaving out roughly 100 contacts with foreign nationals on his initial SF-86, including the time he and his brother-in-law met with a Kremlin-linked lawyer in Trump Tower, and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/09/jared-kushner-voter-registration-female\">registering to vote as a female</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Surprise: fintech start-up run by guys who allegedly propositioned female employees, offered women money to lose weight is dropping its expansion plans</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/sofi-workplace-culture-harassment\">Back in September</a>, <strong>Mike Cagney,</strong> the C.E.O. of financial technology start-up Social Finance (a.k.a. SoFi), announced that he would be stepping down from the company, which may or may not have had something to do with allegations that, among other things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cagney, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/employees-of-fintech-firm-sofi-allege-women-are-treated-improperly-1505062155\">according to a lawsuit filed by an employee who said he was fired for reporting sexual harassment</a>, “fostered a culture of  ‘male bravado’ in which sexual harassment was permitted” and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/technology/sofi-chief-executive-toxic-workplace.html?mcubz=3\">had to be</a> asked by the board to refrain from engaging in “inappropriate conduct with employees.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The company’s chief financial officer until May, <strong>Nino Fanlo,</strong> “would commonly make comments about the physical appearance of female employees and touch their shoulders in ways that made them uneasy,” like the time he allegedly commented on a female job applicant’s breasts in full view of several staff members.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fanlo <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/technology/sofi-chief-executive-toxic-workplace.html?mcubz=3\">said</a> that “women would be happier as homemakers; and once told two female employees he would give them $5,000 if they lost 30 pounds by the end of the year, according to more than a dozen people who heard the comments and witnessed the weight-loss offer.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The corporate culture seemed to be modeled after a frat house; one former employee, <strong>Yulia Zamora,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/technology/sofi-chief-executive-toxic-workplace.html?mcubz=3\">told</a> the <em>Times</em> that she was propositioned by a male supervisor on numerous occasions and that “you would find people having sex in their cars and in the parking lot. It was a free-for-all.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>One manager forced the company to <a href=\"https://dealbreaker.com/2017/09/sofi-scandal-getting-crazier-fast/\">twice replace a toilet</a> after breaking it while having sex with an employee in the company bathroom.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A senior executive <a href=\"https://dealbreaker.com/2017/09/sofi-scandal-getting-crazier-fast/\">allegedly</a> started sexting a female employee while they were both at the same holiday party, threatened her professionally after receiving no response, left the party drunk and crashed his car, and was later promoted.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, shockingly, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fintech-firm-sofi-drops-plan-to-open-a-bank-1507917648\">this is happening</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Online lender Social Finance Inc. said Friday that it is pulling its application to open a bank, retreating from one of its most ambitious goals just weeks after its chief executive resigned as lawsuits claimed sexual harassment and a toxic workplace culture at the company. In June, SoFi had asked Utah state regulators and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to bless its plan to launch a wholly-owned banking subsidiary that would offer customers deposit accounts and credit cards. Michael Cagney, then chief executive of SoFi, had written in a letter to shareholders over the summer that the company was “optimistic that the FDIC will move expeditiously to approve our application.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“With SoFi’s leadership in transition, we’re withdrawing our application with the FDIC for now,” a SoFi spokesman told <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> adding that a bank charter “remains an attractive option when the time is right” and that the company still plans to offer customers its own deposit accounts “through a partner bank in the near future.”</p>\n<p><strong>Even Wall Street is disgusted with Harvey Weinstein</strong></p>\n<p>It’s low on his incredibly long list of problems, but while he’s riding out the news cycle <a

disgraced movie mogul <strong>Harvey Weinstein</strong> might want to reflect on the fact that even Wall Street, whose track record when it comes to sexual harassment <em>might</em> rival Hollywood’s, is repulsed by him. <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2017/10/13/goldman-sachs-weighing-options-for-its-stake-in-weinstein-co/\">According to the <em>New York Post,</em></a> Goldman Sachs is said to be “exploring options” for its stake in the Weinstein Company in the wake of allegations Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-accusers-sexual-harassment-assault-rose-mcgowan-ashley-judd-gwyneth-paltrow\">nearly three dozen women</a>. “There is no place for the inexcusable behavior that had been reported, and we strongly condemn it,” a spokesman for Goldman told the <em>Post.</em> In related news, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported on Friday that Weinstein’s eponymous film and television studio <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-13/would-a-weinstein-co-name-change-wipe-the-stain-of-harvey-s-scandal\">is</a> “exploring a

Patrick","hed":"Should Jamie Dimon Be Terrified About Bitcoin?","body":"<p>Earlier this week, <strong><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/jamie-dimon-billion-dollar-secret-jp-morgan\">Jamie Dimon,</a></strong> the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/12/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-raises-flag-on-trading-revenue-sees-20-percent-fall-for-the-third-quarter.html\">went on a notable, vociferous tirade against Bitcoin</a>, the cryptocurrency that has been associated over the years, fairly or not, with the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-drugs-murder\">Silk Road drug ring</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/exclusive-the-winklevoss-twins-are-so-over-facebook\">the <strong>Winklevoss</strong> twins</a>, and, more recently, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/correction-not-crash-bitcoin-price-eyes-3000-traders-take-profits/\">mind-blowing returns</a>. Over the years, Bitcoin has become a preferred Dimon nemesis. In 2015, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/jamie-dimon-bitcoin-will-not-survive/\">when it was worth around $400 apiece</a>, Dimon predicted that the cryptocurrency wouldn’t survive. This summer, Bitcoin briefly reached a <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/09/02/bitcoin-price-breaks-5000/\">value of $5,000</a> per unit.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Dimon appears relentless in his criticism. The normally genial C.E.O., who also recently indulged in an unrelated rant about the state of the American experiment and all the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/the-real-reason-jamie-dimon-went-berserk-about-america\">“stupid shit”</a> our country is engaged in, appeared uniquely peeved about the recent Bitcoin rally. He called Bitcoin a “fraud.” He said it was “worse than tulip bulbs”&#8212;an arcane reference to the tulip mania that seized 17th-century Holland, a favorite of Wall Street types&#8212;and “limited.” His apoplectic screed didn’t end there, either. He said that Bitcoin was only used by drug dealers and murderers. This wasn’t going to end well, he suggested.</p>\n<p>Dimon is obviously a very smart guy. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/profile/jamie-dimon/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=\">He’s worth</a> an estimated $1.15 billion. He makes around $30 million a year. He went to Harvard Business School, and survived both the financial crisis and a bout with throat cancer while running one of the world’s biggest banking institutions. So I was more than a little surprised to hear someone of his intellectual caliber explain that he would fire an employee “in a second“ for being “stupid“ enough to trade in digital currencies. (It’s particularly confusing because JPMorgan helped create the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a competing cryptocurrency initiative, and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/10/04/jp-morgan-chase-blockchain-ethereum-quorum/\">developed its own cryptocurrency product</a> built on top of Ethereum.) But Dimon was unequivocal. “It’s against our rules, and they’re stupid. And both are dangerous,” he said.</p>\n<p>I have a different theory, however, for why Dimon feels so skeptical about this particular market. I suspect that Bitcoin, and other similar digital currencies, intimidate Wall Street. And if they don’t, they probably should. Putting aside Dimon’s limited understanding of use cases for cryptocurrencies&#8212;if you’re a drug dealer or murderer, for example, the preferable currency <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/01/monero-drug-dealers-cryptocurrency-choice-fire\">is actually Monero</a>, which (so far) is truly anonymous and virtually untraceable&#8212;Bitcoin has remarkable benefits that have spiked demand. Bitcoin, which can be acquired on a number of online exchanges, disrupts the need for a bank to intermediate transactions. It isn’t controlled by any single person; instead, it’s controlled by the peer-to-peer software that allows people to own Bitcoin. Unlike typical financial institutions, you don’t need a driver’s license to open a Bitcoin account; you don’t pay a “bank” to store your money in its vault; and anyone with an Internet connection can access it, use it, and easily buy and sell it across continents, just like all other digital entities.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more important, when I ask people in Silicon Valley which seminal technological advance they think will change the world most in the coming decade, the answer is almost always “the blockchain,” which is the ledger that tracks all transactions for a cryptocurrency. Unlike a traditional bank or corporation, which can be hacked, the blockchain, which is sometimes described as a global spreadsheet, is impossible to break into, and while it’s public, it protects people’s privacy and identities. That technology, people often say, <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/05/08/why-blockchains-will-change-the-world/\">can be applied to anything</a> in the future. For example, you can imagine tracking the financial transactions associated with a politician’s presidential campaign. Or you could imagine buying a skirt steak at Whole Foods, which is part of the blockchain, and being able to see which cow it came from in Portland, and what that cow ate when it was alive. It truly keeps everyone on the blockchain honest.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong: there are plenty of things to worry about when it comes to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. There’s theft, massive and volatile fluctuation in pricing, the government’s attempt to dissuade people from using them, and even increased regulation to deter the growth of the platform. There are people who forget their passwords and then there’s no way of getting a new one. (One friend of mine lost his password and therefore lost connection to tens of thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency.) Most notably, though, cryptocurrencies, unlike cash, are still incredibly confusing to use. And as a result, the market continues to oscillate.</p>\n<p>Dimon’s rant sent the value of Bitcoin plummeting several hundred dollars on the exchanges. But even after that drop, the combined market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is close to $140 billion, half of that belonging to Bitcoin. Perhaps most threatening to Dimon is that these cryptocurrencies add up to 40 percent of the valuation of JPMorgan Chase, which is currently valued at $332 billion.</p>\n<p>Chase is, of course, the biggest bank in America, and in no danger of being usurped any time soon. But as the digital revolution continues to upend our world, it’s worth noting that no institution is permanent any longer. As we watch car companies in Detroit relent to Silicon Valley ride-sharing start-ups, or see Amazon truly eviscerate what is left of retail, one wonders if a full-scale disruption of the banking system is not far in the offing. One thing is abundantly clear: the current financial institutions that we live with today are ripe for disruption. (As my colleague <strong>William D. Cohan</strong> recently noted, JPMorgan Chase paid $13 billion, in part, to suppress a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/jamie-dimon-billion-dollar-secret-jp-morgan\">document</a> alleging a number of improper practices in the run-up to the financial crisis.)</p>\n<p>The banking system has been contorted to make a select few richer, and give way too much control to a handful of ultra-wealthy bankers and C.E.O.s. The same has not yet been proven for Bitcoin and other digital currencies. And for some on Wall Street, that might be pretty scary.</p>\n<h4>Video: Why is Lying the New Normal in the Trump Era?</h4>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/59020600fd2e6176d6000008.js?muted=1\"></div></div>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["bitcoin","jamie dimon","cryptocurrency","jpmorgan chase","blockchain"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Could Bitcoin, and other similar digital currencies, one day render Wall Street irrelevant?","seoTitle":"Should Jamie Dimon Be Terrified About Bitcoin?","seoDescription":"Could Bitcoin, and other similar digital currencies, one day render Wall Street irrelevant?","socialTitle":"Should Jamie Dimon Be Terrified About Bitcoin?","socialDescription":"Could Bitcoin, and other similar digital currencies, one day render Wall Street irrelevant?","issueDate":"","rubric":"Cryptofuturism","promoHed":"Should Jamie Dimon Be Terrified About Bitcoin?","promoDek":"Could Bitcoin, and other similar digital currencies, one day render Wall Street irrelevant?","id":"59b9b249ce1dd60ca2262e3b","revision":11,"createdAt":"September 13, 2017 6:33 pm","modifiedAt":"September 13, 2017 7:24 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"September 13, 2017 7:24 pm","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Erin Vanderhoof","filename":"Jamie-Dimon-Bitcoin.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1544,"height":1029,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/09/13/59b9b2c117d32337b64a9f26_Jamie-Dimon-Bitcoin.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":1028,"width":1542,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1028,"width":1542,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":924,"width":1540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":924,"width":1540,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":686,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":686,"x":429,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":1024,"width":576,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1024,"width":576,"x":484,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":660,"width":1540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":660,"width":1540,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1536,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1536,"x":4,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":1372,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1372,"x":86,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":1029,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1029,"x":257.5,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"Jamie-Dimon-Bitcoin.jpg","credit":"By Eric Piermont/AFP/Getty Images.","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"59b9b2c1c8554637b6806717","revision":3,"createdAt":"September 13, 2017 6:35 pm","modifiedAt":"September 13, 2017 6:36 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"September 13, 2017 6:36 pm","tags":[],"altText":"Jamie Dimon","description":"Getty;

(And, increasingly, the real one, too, for that matter.) Not too long ago, the predominant question was <em>Should I buy the new iPhone?</em> Then it became <em>Do I need to be on Twitter?</em> or <em>Do I need to be on Facebook?</em> or <em>Do I need to be on Snapchat?</em> (That question has since come full circle to <em>Should I quit Twitter and Facebook?</em>) These days, the question I hear the most&#8212;well, besides whether Twitter should ban Trump&#8212;is <em>Should I buy bitcoin?</em></p>\n<p>I usually respond with the story of <strong>Laszlo Hanyecz.</strong> If you’ve come within <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2013/04/logic-problems-bitcoin-bubble\">500 feet of bitcoin</a>, or any other cryptocurrency, over the past few years, the name alone will make you cringe. Back in 2010, when the currency was in its infancy, Hanyecz went “mining” for bitcoins for a few months and collected 10,000 of them; he subsequently traded them, in what would be the first cryptocurrency transaction in history, to a guy who bought him two Papa John’s pizzas with a couple sides of that tasty, buttery garlic sauce. Back then, Hanyecz’s bitcoins had no value, and the $30 value of two pies and an accoutrement made his individual bitcoin units worth 0.003 cents apiece. Today, at their current market valuation, bitcoin units are worth around $5,800 each, which means Hanyecz’s 10,000 bitcoins would be worth around $58 million. “It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” Hanyecz <a href=\"https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/disruptions-betting-on-bitcoin/\">told me</a> in 2013, when bitcoin was already valued at $1,242 each. “No one knew it was going to get so big.”</p>\n<p>For a lot of people on the periphery of this technology, the extraordinary rise in bitcoin’s value has become cause for alarm. The Web is littered with news articles, blog posts, and white papers warning that bitcoin and its sibling currencies are worth nothing, and the rise and fall of the currencies’ worth, which can fluctuate by billions of dollars a minute, certainly backs that up. But while <strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> and other bankers might <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/should-jamie-dimon-be-terrified-about-bitcoin\">scoff</a> at these digital currencies, Silicon Valley is extremely bullish. There’s a reason, too: if <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/jamie-dimon-billion-dollar-secret-jp-morgan\">Dimon had invested</a> in bitcoin when he first called it a joke, in 2015, he would have received a tenfold return on his investment.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>There are a number of reasons why bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are doing so well right now. One of the more plausible scenarios was outlined this week in a very clever <a href=\"https://blog.chain.com/a-letter-to-jamie-dimon-de89d417cb80\">post</a> written by <strong>Adam Ludwin,</strong> an investor and co-founder of Chain.com, a bitcoin developer platform, which argues that bitcoin is an entirely new asset class, similar to equities and bonds, and that “bitcoin is capitalism, distilled.” The “capitalism” part of the sentence helps explain why some in Silicon Valley are so specifically exuberant about it right now. “In the short-run, there will be extreme volatility as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out\">FOMO</a> competes with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt\">FUD</a>, confusion competes with understanding, and greed competes with fear (on both the buyer side and the issuer side),” Ludwin wrote. “Most people buying into crypto assets have checked their judgement at the door.”</p>\n<p>This gets someone like me a bit nervous about what cryptocurrencies could end up doing to society in the long run. Silicon Valley culture is largely fueled by people who love to decimate industries that don’t work, often without any thought of how the disruption could lead to other negative results happening in society (see the recent social-media debacle around the election ). In typical Valley fantasy, people are seeing only the positive potential with bitcoin, not the potentially ugly outcomes when humans molest it for their own interests.</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/59e760be148bb009b9000001.js?muted=1\"></div></div><p>One of the many factors currently fueling the ascent of bitcoin is the rise of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/business/dealbook/initial-coin-offerings-sec-virtual-currency.html\">initial coin offerings</a>, or I.C.O.s, where some lucky investors are reaping astounding returns. You can think of these like a traditional initial public offering, or I.P.O., but without the layers upon layers of regulation and government bureaucracy that come with a company going public. With an I.C.O., a start-up raises money for a new venture by selling “coins” that are very similar to shares of a public company. The coins then rise and fall as the company’s value oscillates. In 2014, when the founding of a new cryptocurrency called Ethereum was announced, it raised $18 million by selling a new digital coin called “Ether” for 40 cents per coin. Today, Ethereum has a market cap of around $30 billion. So if you had spent $100 on Ether during the I.C.O., you would have made $74,900 in profit. As <strong>Nathaniel Popper</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/business/dealbook/coin-digital-currency.html?_r=0\">detailed</a> in <em>The New York Times</em> earlier this summer, I.C.O.s have been generating billions of dollars in returns for some&#8212;and a lot of scams, too.</p>\n<p>The lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency world, after all, means that there is a lot of fraud, extreme volatility, and coin values can jump up or down in mere seconds. Someone I recently spoke with who works with, and monitors, the crypto I.C.O. markets pointed out that some of these I.C.O.s feel awfully similar to the Dot Com public offerings of the late 90s, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/08/is-silicon-valley-in-another-bubble\">where the public was buying into nothing</a> and ended up with exactly that when the entire market came crashing down and trillions of dollars were wiped off the stock market. In China, I.C.O.s became so troubling that they were banned earlier this year. In September, the People’s Bank of China issued a blunt statement <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-ico-ban-understandable-reasonable-probably-temporary/\">saying that this practice was</a> “illegal and disruptive to economic and financial stability.” I.C.O.s in China were occurring at an astounding rate, with one report claiming that more than $750 million was raised in I.C.O.s in July and August alone. A lot of people think the ban by China is temporary, slowing the dizzying speed of these offerings.</p>\n<p>As a result of all the movement in the cryptocurrency market over the past couple of years, there are a lot of options out there for people who want to try their hand in crypto-investing. There’s bitcoin, the first and most well known of all the currencies, which currently oscillates in value at around $5,000 a coin. I’ve heard predictions all over the map, from bitcoins one day being worth as much as $500,000 each to units being worth absolutely nothing if a better coin comes along. (My personal prediction is that they will continue to rise for at least the next couple of years.) Ether had remained relatively flat until earlier this year when it spiked in value to over $350 apiece. (It’s since fallen to $300 each.) The current coin du jour is called Litecoin, which is getting a lot of attention because it’s still priced relatively low, at around $55 each, and is expected to rise considerably over the next year or so on account of new features that will be added to enable more privacy options. Then there are a slew of other coins to explore, including Monero, which is an open-source currency that was developed in April 2014, but which spiked this year after the illegal drug market AlphaBay was taken down. Monero, unlike other currencies, is truly anonymous, making it the perfect currency with which to buy and sell drugs, guns, and other illegal contraband on the Dark Web. If you look at <a href=\"https://www.worldcoinindex.com/\">the World Coin Index</a> Web site, you can see a long list of other coins and their values over time, including Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Qtum, NEO, Nav Coin, NEM, and a number of other coins.</p>\n<p>For Silicon Valley, betting on one of these early can mean profiting beyond all imagination, exceeding even the famed 1,000x start-up returns from companies like Facebook and Uber. Earlier this summer, I <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/exclusive-the-winklevoss-twins-are-so-over-facebook\">interviewed</a> <strong>Tyler</strong> and <strong>Cameron Winklevoss,</strong> the twins who co-founded The Facebook with <strong>Mark Zuckerberg,</strong> and they are now obsessively investing in cryptocurrencies. In a settlement with Facebook, the two brothers were awarded $60 million, but to hear them talk about it, it appears their investments in bitcoin and other currencies are going to reap a far bigger return over time. I’ve spoken with countless other people about the current state of bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and I’ve heard two truths that seems consistent. No one&#8212;and I mean no one&#8212;knows exactly which digital currency will be successful in the future. It could be bitcoin, it could be Litecoin, it could be something that hasn’t even been created yet. But, the other resounding feeling is that these currencies are here to stay in one form or another and there is nothing anyone can do to stop them. Which brings me back to that question that I’m often asked these days: “should I buy bitcoin?”</p>\n<p>There’s an old saying in real estate that “you shouldn’t wait to buy, but rather you should buy and then wait.” That’s the way I feel about these cryptocurrencies. If you’re looking for a quick and dramatic financial boost, realize that you could probably get similar odds by buying a plane ticket to Las Vegas, walking into the first casino you see, and putting all your money on black or red. But, if you’re willing to wait it out, there’s a chance that your investment in a cryptocurrency could make for an impressive return over time. Just be prepared to go it the long haul. Or at least until the price spikes tomorrow.</p>\n</section>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Business","tags":["bitcoin","jamie dimon","cryptocurrency"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Cryptocurrencies are on a historic tear right now.

JPMorgan Chase’s settlement raised many eyebrows on Wall Street. The huge settlement appeared inconsistent with the oft-repeated narrative of the bank’s heroism during the crisis. <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/the-real-reason-jamie-dimon-went-berserk-about-america\">JPMorgan Chase and its C.E.O.</a>, <strong>Jamie Dimon,</strong> after all, were appropriately lauded for swooping in to save both Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, acts of financial patriotism that certainly helped prevent the U.S. economy from further doubling over upon itself.</p>\n<p>But people wondered why one of Wall Street’s ostensible white knights would pay $13 billion&#8212;$9 billion of its shareholders’ cash, plus another $4 billion in mortgage relief&#8212;in a government case. During a conference call on the morning that the settlement was announced, <strong>Mike Mayo,</strong> a veteran Wall Street analyst, <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/jamie-dimons-13-billion-secret/\">asked</a> Dimon and bank C.F.O. <strong>Marianne Lake</strong> the question that appeared to be on the minds of everyone in the financial-services industry: “How is it that JPMorgan got front and center with this issue? That it’s the Department of Justice working out an agreement with JPMorgan when JPMorgan performed so well during the crisis, yet here’s the one bank that’s paying a $13 billion fine?” Without missing a beat, Dimon retorted, “Mike, you’ve got to ask them, O.K.?” In other words, Dimon seemed to be saying to Mayo, as he later put it in Davos, that the whole thing was <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-dimon/jpmorgan-ceo-dimon-says-government-cases-were-unfair-idUSBREA0M0PL20140123\">“unfair.”</a></p>\n<p>A number of clues about what had forced Dimon’s hand, however, began emerging soon after the conference call. As I <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/jamie-dimons-13-billion-secret/\">reported</a> in <em>The Nation</em> in 2014, JPMorgan Chase’s settlement came at the end of an intense series of negotiations with a wide range of government officials. Perhaps the most pivotal moment in the conversations occurred in September 2013 when D.O.J. lawyers shared with Dimon and his attorneys a draft of a 92-page civil complaint that <strong>Benjamin B. Wagner,</strong> the then U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of California, and his colleagues were prepared to file in federal court. The draft complaint&#8212;based upon hundreds of thousands of subpoenaed internal JPMorgan documents; and interviews with its bankers, employees in its mortgage-backed securities division, and third-party mortgage originator&#8212;alleged that the bank’s due-diligence process had been subverted, and ignored, during the years before the crisis. In Wagner’s narrative, the bank was not nearly the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2010/06/pecora-201006\">white knight of Wall Street.</a></p>\n<p>No one knew <em>precisely</em> what Wagner’s investigation had uncovered about JPMorgan Chase, however, because his brief was never filed publicly. Within weeks of Wagner sharing a draft copy of the complaint with Dimon&#8212;and following a tense face-to-face meeting at the Department of Justice between Dimon and <strong>Eric Holder,</strong> then the U.S. attorney general&#8212;the two sides agreed to the $13 billion settlement, at the time the largest ever. (It has since been surpassed by Bank of America’s <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/bank-america-pay-1665-billion-historic-justice-department-settlement-financial-fraud-leading\">$16.65 billion fine</a>, settling similar claims.) In return, the Department of Justice agreed with Dimon and JPMorgan Chase that, among other things, it would not file Wagner’s complaint. Instead, an anodyne 11-page <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/94320131119151031990622.pdf\">“Statement of Facts” </a> was released. But it didn’t offer a tremendous amount of insight. “Much of it was the same-old-same-old, a not-very-lively description of a corrupted Wall Street mortgage factory,” <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/business/13-billion-from-jpmorgan-chase-yes-but-what-took-so-long.html?mcubz=3\">wrote</a> <strong>Gretchen Morgenson</strong> in <em>The New York Times,</em> “based largely on some facts that have been in the public domain for years.”</p>\n<h4>Video: Vintage <em>V.F.:</em> Bernie Madoff’s Victims Speak Out</h4>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5367df3a69702d45c9190000.js?muted=1\"></div></div><p>Wall Street C.E.O.s have many reasons for using their shareholders’ money to settle nettlesome lawsuits&#8212;from “optics” and brand preservation, to boosting their stock price and keeping embarrassing facts out of the public’s hands. And in the wake of his bank’s $13 billion settlement, Dimon made clear that he was frustrated that the bank had to settle. At a Microsoft C.E.O. summit, Dimon <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/jamie-dimons-13-billion-secret/\">confessed</a> that he “had to control his rage” regarding the topic.</p>\n<p>To keen observers, though, it also seemed that he and JPMorgan Chase appeared intent on keeping Wagner’s unfiled complaint out of the public record. The specter of the document becoming public was again raised in a separate court case, when, a few weeks after the Department of Justice announced the settlement with JPMorgan Chase, lawyers for the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, which had sued JPMorgan Chase’s investment bank, along with other defendants, alleging it had sold the bank more than $1.7 billion in squirrelly mortgage-backed securities, wanted a copy of Wagner’s complaint. In fact, a state judge in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, ordered the bank to turn over the draft complaint. But JPMorgan Chase settled the litigation after the judge’s ruling&#8212;a settlement that, among other things, included a provision that the draft complaint was to remain private. (Disclosure: after JPMorgan Chase fired me as a managing director in January 2004, I brought&#8212;and lost&#8212;an arbitration claim against the bank. I also remain in litigation with the bank as the result of a soured investment I made in 1999.)</p>\n<p>Now, nearly four years later, as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit initiated by <strong>Daniel Novack,</strong> an enterprising First Amendment attorney in New York City, the D.O.J. sent Novack a partially redacted copy of Wagner’s curiosity-stoking draft complaint against JPMorgan Chase. Novack provided a copy of the partially redacted complaint to me. “By this action,” the draft complaint begins, “the United States seeks to recover civil penalties” against JPMorgan Chase and its investment banking arm “for a fraudulent and deceptive scheme to package and sell residential mortgage-backed securities” that the bank “knew contained a material amount of materially defective loans.” As the unfiled complaint continued, “JPMorgan knowingly securitized and sold billions of dollars of mortgage loans that were originated in material violation of underwriting guidelines and law.” (When reached for comments and responses to the various allegations in Wagner’s unfiled brief, a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase told me, “These allegations have been addressed, resolved, or refuted years ago.”)</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Wagner’s unfiled brief catalogs behavior rather at odds with the public narrative about the bank in the years preceding the crisis. It further asserts that JPMorgan Chase knew that “many of these loans were tainted with fraud” and “knowingly misrepresented” that the loans met its underwriting guidelines, even though they clearly did not, and that the loans had sufficient equity value to collateralize the mortgages even though they did not. Notably, Wagner’s complaint argues that “these fraudulent misrepresentations” cost investors “to suffer billions of dollars in losses.”</p>\n<p>Wagner wrote in the unfiled complaint that, according to his investigation, <strong>Christine Cole</strong> and <strong>Bill King,</strong> managing directors at JPMorgan Securities, ran the Securitized Products Group inside the investment bank that manufactured and sold the tainted mortgaged-backed securities in hopes of generating fees that would lead to large end-of-year bonuses for them and other members of the group. The bonuses ranged into the millions of dollars, and could be many times the size of the bankers’ and traders’ salaries. Between 2005 and 2007, Wagner wrote, “the year-end bonuses of the traders and salespeople rose significantly, in correlation with the spike in volume of [residential mortgage-backed securities] issuances at JPMorgan.”</p>\n<p>The unfiled complaint also alleges that the JPMorgan Chase bankers and traders acquired mortgages from third-party originators with the sole intention of packaging up the mortgages into securities and selling them off quickly to investors in exchange for large fees. Wagner wrote that the bankers, traders, and employees responsible for carefully scrutinizing the mortgages being packaged up and sold knew they were acquiring loans with material defects that would be securitized and sold to investors. The bank, the unfiled brief continues, “ignored its due diligence findings and securitized materially defective loans” and “knowingly purchased and securitized loans with material credit and compliance defects.” The document further alleges that the bank, and its employees, knowingly sold mortgage-related securities with “inflated appraisals” and that “ignored internal controls” and that it “intentionally misrepresented” to investors “the quality of the loans” in offering documents, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the securities.</p>\n<p>Worse, the unfiled brief notes, the bank continued to sell mortgage-backed securities even though Dimon himself was worried that the residential mortgage-backed securities market was about to crash. According to Wagner, during the second week of October 2006, Dimon allegedly told King, the co-head of the Securitized Products Group, that he needed to “watch out for subprime”&#8212;a reference to low-quality mortgage-backed securities&#8212;because he feared that the market “could go up in smoke.” The document also notes that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/business/2012/11/jamie-dimon-tom-brady-hang-in-there\">Dimon wanted King to reduce the bank’s exposure</a> to that market. The “impetus” for Dimon’s concern, Wagner continues, was his review of reports from the mortgage-servicing arm of the bank that showed that delinquencies on such mortgages “were rising at an alarming rate.” At Dimon’s “insistence,” the unfiled complaint asserts, “JPMorgan formulated an exit strategy to divest itself” of the riskiest pieces of mortgage-backed securities that had been accumulating on its balance sheet. But, Wagner writes in the draft complaint, “despite knowledge at the highest levels that underwriting had deteriorated across the industry and early payment defaults were spiking, JPMorgan continued to purchase and securitize subprime loans without addressing the known breakdown of its due diligence practices and without disclosing its knowledge to investors.” This is pretty much the exact same thing that Goldman Sachs did leading up to the financial crisis, a practice for which the bank was roundly criticized.</p>\n<p>Wagner’s unfiled complaint provided details on 10 allegedly fraudulent mortgage-backed securities that JPMorgan Chase underwrote and sold to investors. (Four of the 10 examples were redacted in the copy the D.O.J. provided to Novack and that Novack provided to me, because “the D.O.J. contends that these paragraphs contain information pertaining to an ongoing investigation,” according to a recent ruling in Novack’s case.)</p>\n<p>The draft complaint further stated that the 10 examples “do not encompass the full extent of JPMorgan’s fraudulent scheme.” In one un-redacted example, the U.S. attorney’s office in the Eastern District of California described what happened to a $1 billion security that JPMorgan underwrote in August 2006 that contained more than 5,500 mortgages issued by Countrywide Financial, then an independent public company (and now part of Bank of America). Prior to purchasing the Countrywide pool, one-quarter of the loans were tested by an independent third-party consultant hired by JPMorgan. The third-party evaluator’s report, received by JPMorgan in May 2006, showed that up to 17 percent of the mortgages contained “material” defects, including “excessive” loan-to-value ratios, “incomplete or defective” appraisals, and missing verifications of income, employment, or assets at closing, among other problems.</p>\n<p>According to Wagner’s draft complaint, after JPMorgan received the third-party report showing the defects in the mortgages, the company’s bankers “manipulated” the results by re-categorizing the defective mortgages because of “missing documents,” which lowered their risk assessment and made them appear to comply with the bank’s underwriting standards. But, according to Wagner’s unfiled complaint, “these missing documents were not delivered” and despite “knowledge of the material defects in the Countrywide pool,” JPMorgan Chase nevertheless bought 99 percent of the mortgages, and securitized all but seven of them into what became known as JPMAC 2006-CW2. Furthermore, the bank “did not inform investors of material amount of materially defective loans” that created the security. Wagner’s complaint, drafted seven years after the security was issued, noted that JPMAC 2006-CW2 “has suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in cumulative lost principal balance, and more losses are projected.” The complaint noted that although the top tranches of the security were once rated AAA, they had since been downgraded to “junk bond” status or below. And some had defaulted.</p>\n<p>In another un-redacted example from Wagner’s complaint, a mortgage-backed security that JPMorgan Chase underwrote in February 2007&#8212;relatively late in the cycle&#8212;for some $980 million contained around 35 percent of mortgages originated by GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. The mortgages, which were drawn from two pools with unpaid principal balances of $459 million and $300 million, respectively, had many of the same underwriting flaws as found in the Countrywide mortgages. Once again, JPMorgan hired a third-party consultant to look at a sample of them and to report back to it about their quality. Approximately 25 percent of the sample evaluated came back as containing unacceptable risks because of the low quality of the initial underwriting. According to Wagner’s draft complaint, “JPMorgan had knowledge that a substantial portion of the loans did not comply with the originator’s underwriting guidelines and had a substantial risk of default.” The bank packaged up the GreenPoint mortgages and sold them anyway. In the end, investors suffered “hundreds of millions of dollars” of losses on that one security. In all, the unfiled document concludes, JPMorgan Chase and its investment bank “reaped substantial profits from their fraudulent scheme, having sold over $25 billion in nonprime RMBS”&#8212;residential mortgage-backed securities&#8212;“certificates backed by toxic loans.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Mythmaking is a blood sport on Wall Street, and few are better at the game than Dimon. While Dimon has not been shy about <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/04/04/trump-jamie-dimon-letter-to-shareholders-jp-morgan/\">criticizing</a> <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and his many offensive policy proposals, it is worth recalling that he was considered a leading candidate to be Trump’s Treasury secretary and served on the president’s Strategy and Policy Forum (until he resigned last month in protest of the president’s response to Charlottesville). One of Dimon’s main jobs as C.E.O. is to find his successor, but so far one top executive after another has left the firm, with many of them becoming C.E.O.s at other financial institutions. (<strong>Matt Zames,</strong> the bank’s 46-year-old chief operating officer, became the latest Dimon heir apparent to leave JPMorgan Chase when he departed unexpectedly in June. “We have huge success and great people for succession of the bank,” Dimon told CNBC in August.)</p>\n<p>Dimon had harsh words, of course, for the Obama administration over his belief that his bank was treated unfairly by the Department of Justice in the $13 billion settlement. Instead of penalizing the bank for its bad behavior, Dimon argued, it should be celebrated for helping to save the financial system from its further free fall. That may be true to some degree, but Wagner’s 92-page draft complaint puts the wood to Dimon’s spin machine and shows that he and his colleagues at the bank were no different than the rest of the Wall Street banksters who received big bonuses for packaging up mortgages they knew would not be repaid into securities that they could sell to investors for big fees. Dimon’s pay package for 2013, the year of the big government settlement, was $20 million&#8212;a raise of 74 percent from the year before.</p>\n</section>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Business","tags":["jamie dimon","jp morgan","department of justice","jp morgan chase & co"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Four years ago, JPMorgan Chase reached a then-record settlement with the Department of Justice after, among other things, the bank received a copy of a U.S. attorney’s draft complaint documenting its alleged role in underwriting fraudulent securities in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.

They knew their pair of lovers, Jamie and Claire Fraser, would be separated by a cruel twist of time travel for several episodes, but here the source material provided some complications. In Gabaldon’s <em>Voyager,</em> the plot follows Jamie on every twist and turn of his journey over the many decades he and his wife spend apart, but Claire’s journey is far vaguer. “Claire didn’t have an equivalent journey in the book. In the book it takes place mostly from Claire’s perspective in 1968, while she, Roger, and Brianna are doing research on Jamie&#8212;kind of where we left them at the end of Season 2, and then eventually she goes back,” show-runner <strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong> explained to <em>Radio Times</em> earlier this month.</p>\n<p>So what’s a largely faithful adaptation to do? Well this lack of Claire narrative actually gave Moore and his writers some freedom to get a bit creative with the source material. This may rankle <em>some</em> die-hard fans, but the <em>Outlander</em> writers appear to have relished the challenge of diving into the fraught relationship with Frank, the birth of Brianna, and Claire’s groundbreaking decision to become a doctor. You may have missed the delicate way in which the writers plotted a path for Claire that largely mirrors the one her Scottish husband is taking.</p>\n<p>Sure, Claire doesn’t grow a mangy beard, but as producer/writer <strong>Toni Graphia</strong> pointed out the while Claire’s cave (a.k.a. her well-appointed home with Frank) was “better decorated” than Jamie’s, both were trapped victims of their circumstances. Both found solace and joy in an infant (Jamie with his sister’s baby, Claire with Brianna), and, of course, Claire wasn’t the only Fraser performing some kind of surgery this week. He’s forced to remember all the medical lessons Claire taught him in order to save the life of his adopted son, Fergus.</p>\n<p>The loss of young Fergus’s hand <em>is</em> something that happens in the book though the Starz series ramped up the drama a bit by making the boy’s confrontation with the soldiers a little higher-stakes. Fergus doesn’t provoke the attack in quite the same way in the novel, but the <em>Outlander</em> writers were eager to put audiences more firmly in his point of view.</p>\n<p>As hard as that amputation may have been for Fergus lovers to watch, from a technical standpoint, the loss of Fergus’s hand presented its own repugnant challenge for the <em>Outlander</em> crew. In a post-episode interview, Graphia, Moore, and producer <strong>Matt Roberts</strong> explained that all the prosthetics for the series come in a distinctive metal box. They ticked off the horrors that have come in those boxes: “Fergus’s head,” “Baby Faith,” “the Duke of Sandringham’s head.” At this point, they joked, nobody wants to be the one to open the box and see which photo-realistic terror awaits them.</p>\n<p>It’s onward and upward for Fergus, though. He may not have both hands, but the French boy will live to love and fight another day&#8212;soon to be played as an adult by <strong><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/10/outlander-season-3-fergus\">César Domboy</a>.</strong> In other words, time will continue to race forward and the decades will stretch on for Claire and Jamie until they are finally, <em>finally</em> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/07/outlander-comic-con-photos-premiere-season-3-video-print-shop-jamie\">reunited</a>.</p>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","tags":["outlander","claire fraser","jamie parallels","fergus","subtle claire"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Even decades apart, the lovers are still connected.","seoTitle":"Outlander: The Subtle Claire and Jamie Parallels You Might Have Missed in “Surrender”","seoDescription":"Even decades apart, the lovers are still connected.","socialTitle":"Outlander: The Subtle Claire and Jamie Parallels You Might Have Missed in “Surrender”","socialDescription":"Even decades apart, the lovers are still connected.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Outlandish","promoHed":"<em>Outlander:</em> The Subtle Claire and Jamie Parallels You Might Have Missed in “Surrender”","promoDek":"Even decades apart, the lovers are still connected.","id":"59bf0fc5d4d6c637279d0a4e","revision":21,"createdAt":"September 17, 2017 8:13 pm","modifiedAt":"September 17, 2017 10:09 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"September 17, 2017 10:09 pm","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Joanna Robinson","filename":"outlander-surrender.png","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"PNG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/09/18/59bf11293c835b0539799dd6_outlander-surrender.png"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":640,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":640,"x":400,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":540,"x":450,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":615,"width":1435,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":615,"width":1435,"x":2.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":810,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":810,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1280,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1280,"x":80,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":960,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":960,"x":240,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"outlander-surrender.png","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"59bf112a3c835b0539799dd7","revision":1,"createdAt":"September 17, 2017 8:19 pm","modifiedAt":"September 17, 2017 8:20 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"September 17, 2017 8:20 pm","credit":"Courtesy of Starz","tags":[],"altText":"","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Joanna Robinson is a Hollywood writer covering TV and film for VanityFair.com.

The <em>Eastbound &amp; Down</em> dream team of <strong>Danny McBride</strong> and <strong>David Gordon Green</strong> are working on the script for the film, which will be financed by <strong>Jason Blum</strong>’s Blumhouse Productions (the studio behind this year’s runaway hit <em>Get Out</em>, among others), and Carpenter himself even teased that he might compose the music.

But she looks none the worse for wear in Blum’s photo!</p>\n<p>Besides, it’s not like Hollywood is unable to find workarounds for these kinds of things. The <em>X-Men</em> franchise neatly retconned the events of <em>The Last Stand</em> a few years ago, the new seasons of <em>Will and Grace</em> will pretend the last one didn’t even happen, and <strong>John Goodman</strong>’s Dan Conner is alive and well in the upcoming <em>Roseanne</em> revival.

You can’t change one line of the print shop,’” she continued, lovingly mimicking the show’s concerned fans. But you don’t need to be an avid reader of <strong>Diana Gabaldon’s</strong> books to know that any scene involving Claire and Jamie back together again would be a popular one.</p>\n<p>The scene <em>is</em> altered a bit in the adaptation. The episode, frustratingly, cuts off <em>just</em> after Jamie faints (as he does in the books)&#8212;but before the long-separated lovers can lay a finger on each other. Things go a little differently in the books, where Claire and Jaime do touch before he passes out. Claire narrates:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There was no more than a foot between us. I reached out tentatively\nand touched the tiny line of the break, where the bone pressed white\nagainst the bronze of his skin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He flinched backward as though an electric spark had arced between us,\nand the calm expression shattered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You’re real,” he whispered. I had thought him pale already. Now all\nvestiges of color drained from his face. His eyes rolled up and he\nslumped to the floor in a shower of papers and oddments that had been\nsitting on the press&#8212;he fell rather gracefully for such a large man, I\nthought abstractedly.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The slight change in adaptation, of course, allows for a juicier cliffhanger this week. But don’t worry, Claire and Jamie fans: the trailer for next week’s extended Episode 6 makes it <em>quite</em> clear that you won’t have to wait long for that. And that’s not the only slight manipulation in this otherwise stellar episode. Last year, both Balfe and Heughan were reluctant to go into detail about how their two characters would be aged up after twenty years apart. “There was an aging process,” Heughan <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/10/outlander-season-3-sam-heughan\">said</a> vaguely, before pivoting to the “hours and hours” of makeup he has to endure whenever Jamie shows the audience his scarred back. Balfe focused more on Claire’s state of mind, and the challenge of playing someone who has lived several decades more than she has:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It definitely is a tough thing to try and figure out where you would\nbe in 20 years, and then to do it for somebody else. I was talking to\nsomeone recently, and she was saying how every person feels a certain\nage for the rest of their life. For her grandmother, she always felt\nlike she was 21. A friend of mine was saying, ”I think 28. I must’ve\nbeen so happy at 28, that that’s how I always see myself.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With Claire, I latched onto that. When she has gone back to Boston and\nshe’s not with Jamie, she’s a mother and she’s very professional, but\nshe’s put a side of herself away. That kind of sexual, romantic side\nof herself has been shelved almost for 20 years. When she gets back to\nJamie, she’s back to that&#8212;27, 28, or whatever age she was supposed to\nbe&#8212;time when she first met him because that’s when she really, I\nthink, first came alive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That answer makes much more sense now, when we’ve see that despite Claire’s adult daughter and the grey in her hair in the 60s plot line, once she goes back to Scotland, she looks fairly identical to the way she did when she left two decades previously. (Thank you, Clairol.) So does Heughan, with the exception of some spectacles; it hardly looks like a day has passed since the Frasers last saw each other.</p>\n<p>This feels like a slight missed opportunity for <em>Outlander</em>, which has been so sex positive; it could have genuinely explored the insecurities attached to aging and long separation. If Claire and Jamie <em>do</em> feel older as they face each other next week, we, the audience, will hardly be able to tell.</p>\n<h4>Video: <em>Outlander</em> Stars Reunite for a Recap</h4>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/59b32cfe148bb07de400001a.js?muted=1\"></div></div><p>But before Claire and Jamie could get to the part of their reunion where they strip down, Balfe first had to slip back out of her 60s fashion and into something a bit more appropriate for her journey.

It’s been a complicated dual role for Menzies&#8212;but, having hung up Black Jack Randall’s wig in the Season 3 premiere and Frank Randall’s fedora by Episode 3, the actor’s tenure on the series is now officially over. What does the show even look like without Frank and Black Jack driving a wedge between the Frasers?</p>\n<p>In the behind-the-scenes video above, Menzies comes to terms with his departure from the show. “It’s mixed emotions,” he says with the same heavy sigh most actors give when they leave a show. “I will miss everyone greatly.”</p>\n<p>Without tooting his own horn, Menzies gives a nod to all the nuance and shades of grey he brought to a character like Black Jack Randall. Given the rape and torture he visits on our heroes, Black Jack could have easily been a sneering, black-and-white villain. But as Menzies observes, “It always gives you lots to work with when there are contradictions within a person.” In the footage here, we see Menzies blocking out his final fight with <strong>Sam Heughan’s</strong> Jamie&#8212;including the key, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/outlander-season-3-premiere-recap-black-jack-randall-dies-death-tobias-menzies-improvised\">improvised</a> moment where Jack reaches out, piteously, as he falls.</p>\n<p>Menzies didn’t get a big dying scene for Claire’s long-suffering husband, Frank; he died off-screen in a car crash. Instead, we had to watch the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/outlander-recap-season-3-episode-3-all-debts-paid-frank-dies-lord-john-grey\">slow, tormented death of their marriage</a> over the span of several episodes. Here, too, Menzies and the writers brought added shades of grey. “He’s the antidote to everything that Jack is,” Menzies says with enormous sympathy for the man who raised Jamie’s child. “He’s a really great, complex character that <strong>Diana [Gabaldon]</strong> has given us in the books. He’s the less flash of the two, but I really feel the writers did a good job in fleshing him out from the books. It’s been a good ride.”</p>\n<p>There will always be menacing Scots, imperious French, and (spoiler alert) brash Americans to ensure that Claire and Jamie don’t get to live out the rest of their days in peace. But none will ever hold a candle to the Randalls&#8212;nor to Menzies, who disappeared so completely into two complex men.</p>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","tags":["tobias menzies","black jack randall","outlander","jamie fraser","claire"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"The show’s most notorious villain gives a tender farewell.","seoTitle":"Outlander: An Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Look at Tobias Menzies’ Emotional Goodbye","seoDescription":"The show’s most notorious villain gives a tender farewell.","socialTitle":"Outlander: An Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Look at Tobias Menzies’ Emotional Goodbye","socialDescription":"The show’s most notorious villain gives a tender farewell.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Outlandish","promoHed":"Outlander: An Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Look at Tobias Menzies’ Emotional Goodbye","promoDek":"The show’s most notorious villain gives a tender farewell.","id":"59c8f62e0a147d053a84e79a","revision":13,"createdAt":"September 25, 2017 8:27 am","modifiedAt":"September 25, 2017 9:13 am","revisionCreatedAt":"September 25, 2017 9:13 am","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Joanna Robinson","filename":"outlander-tobias-menzies.png","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"PNG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/09/25/59c8f7eba7823e560061b75e_outlander-tobias-menzies.png"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":640,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":640,"x":400,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":540,"x":450,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":615,"width":1435,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":615,"width":1435,"x":2.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":810,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":810,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1280,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1280,"x":80,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":960,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":960,"x":240,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"outlander-tobias-menzies.png","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"59c8f7eba7823e560061b75f","revision":0,"createdAt":"September 25, 2017 8:34 am","modifiedAt":"September 25, 2017 8:34 am","revisionCreatedAt":"September 25, 2017 8:34 am","modelName":"photo","altText":""}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Joanna Robinson is a Hollywood writer covering TV and film for VanityFair.com.

But <strong>Tobias Menzies</strong> got to have two. The actor <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/outlander-season-3-premiere-recap-black-jack-randall-dies-death-tobias-menzies-improvised\">stole the show</a> in the Season 3 premiere, especially when Menzies improvised his villainous character, Black Jack Randall, reaching out in futile yearning as he collapsed into the arms of Jamie Fraser (<strong>Sam Hueghan</strong>) during the Battle of Culloden. And this week, it was Claire (<strong>Caitriona Balfe</strong>) who wrapped a dying (well, already dead) Menzies in her arms as <em>Outlander</em> fans said a final goodbye to poor Frank Randall.</p>\n<p>The showrunners have <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/outlander-recap-season-3-episode-2-surrender-fergus-hand\">spoken at length</a> about expanding Claire’s story in Season 3 from the books so that she and Jamie can share equal screen time during their long separation. But in the end, they also wound up creating a compelling and emotionally rich story for Frank&#8212;at times, at the expense of sympathy for Claire. It was a risky move, but one that paid off beautifully in Frank and Claire’s final moments.</p>\n<p>In the novels, the twenty-year-long marriage of Claire and Frank Randall is told largely in flashback. As show watchers did last season, readers learn that Frank died suddenly in the late 1960s via a passing comment from Claire. But in Season 3, <em>Outlander</em> wound back the clock to show us the long slow death of the Randall marriage. Claire, it’s clear, is never able to let go of Jamie. (This would hardly be a story about star-crossed soulmates if she could.) During a series of confrontations that spool out over decades, Frank observes, accurately, that their bedroom is “far too crowded” with the memory of Jamie. In his final confrontation with Claire, Frank theorizes that it was their daughter Brianna, with her bright red hair, who kept the memory of Jamie alive all these years. Without Brianna, could Claire have forgotten Jamie and found happiness with Frank over time? Claire dramatically responds: “That amount of time doesn’t exist.”</p>\n<p>Her steadfast devotion to Jamie is romantic, sure, but it also makes her outrage towards Frank often feel unjust. She lashes out at him for an instance in which his mistress, Sandy, shows up at the house and embarrasses her. But it’s hard for Claire to have the moral high ground when, time-travel-induced excuses aside, she cheated on Frank and gave her heart away, forever, to another person. She then chose to continue to live with Frank. Denying her husband both love <em>and</em> his right to achieve that kind of happiness for himself makes Claire seem enormously unsympathetic. At least for a time.</p>\n<p>Adaptive changes also weigh this long, slow conflict in Frank’s favor. As he is in the book, Frank is devoted to young Brianna while Claire absents herself from the family and buries herself in her work. But the Starz series also turns Frank’s multiple infidelities from the book into one long-running affair with a woman whom he claims to love. There aren’t a string of “betrayals”&#8212;just one relationship which both he and Claire agreed he might pursue. Also gone is his repugnant racism. In the book, it’s easier to write Frank off as a bad person after he says some nasty things about Claire’s friendship with her African-American colleague, Joe, and his son Lenny. (This is far from the only change from the books in this episode, and you can read showrunner <strong>Ron D. Moore</strong> discuss Murtagh’s unexpected survival <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2017/09/24/outlander-recap-season-3-episode-3-frank-dies-death-murtagh-alive-lord-john-grey/#U70iaD5UDkqT\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p>Instead of a racist philanderer, the show version of Frank becomes a heartbroken man who stays with a woman he still loves for fear of losing his daughter. Even during their most heated confrontations, Frank is fairly gentle. “This is why we were never good at charades, darling,” he wryly observes. This more nuanced Frank not only creates a far more complex fallout from Claire and Jamie’s love story, but also establishes yet another parallel for the separated Frasers. In <em>his</em> timeline, Jamie encounters a heartbroken man who (eventually) loves him: Lord John Grey (<strong>David Berry</strong>). Much like Claire and Frank, Jamie and John alternatively spar and find common ground and mutual understanding. Berry’s take on Grey, like Menzies’ on Frank, is enormously sympathetic and compelling. He also has a much easier job; Lord John Grey is a hugely popular character in the novels.</p>\n<p>But for Frank, that extra dimension comes at the risk of making Claire somewhat unsympathetic&#8212;which constitutes brave storytelling from the <em>Outlander</em> team. We can feel for Claire and her heartbreak while also acknowledging that all-consuming heartbreak renders her selfish and occasionally unkind to Brianna and Frank. The swooning romance of <em>Outlander</em> might be its most broadly appealing feature (as in, even those who have never watched the show know it’s about sexy times in Scotland), but it won’t necessarily be its most enduring. In order to survive past the heady rush of the first few seasons and follow down the long and winding path laid by <strong>Diana Gabaldon’s</strong> books, <em>Outlander</em> will have to continue to build up its supporting players.

It is the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-25/trudeau-s-reward-for-courting-trump-is-a-trade-war-over-lumber\">No.1 buyer of our goods</a>, and its trade relationship with the U.S. is “largely balanced . . . totaling $635 billion in 2016.” Canada’s prime minister, <strong>Justin Trudeau,</strong> has very charitably claimed that President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> “actually listens and is opening to changing his mind,“ and he and the First Lady <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/10/justin-trudeau-ivanka-trump-fortune-most-powerful-women-summit?mbid=social_twitter\">treated</a> <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> and <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> to a night at the theater last March. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-25/trudeau-s-reward-for-courting-trump-is-a-trade-war-over-lumber\">In the first several months</a> of Trump’s presidency, our northern neighbors “flooded Washington with envoys” and “relentlessly talked up Canada-U.S. ties.” In other words, Canada is like one of those people whose perpetual friendliness you’re suspicious of until you come to realize they’re just genuinely <em>that nice.</em> So, naturally, Donald Trump has been doing everything he can to provoke the country and on Tuesday, he finally succeeded.</p>\n<p>Following a tense fourth round of NAFTA negotiations between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, wherein even the U.S. delegation <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/even-trumps-delegates-think-his-nafta-demands-are-ridiculous\">appeared</a> to be “uncomfortable with the demands they [were] presenting” on the Trump administration’s behalf, representatives for the three nations announced on Tuesday that they would not reconvene until November 17. In contrast to a previously <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-10/trump-welcomes-trudeau-to-washington-with-another-nafta-threat\">upbeat tone</a> re: NAFTA, Canada slammed non-starter proposals from the U.S., such as one to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-16/u-s-is-said-to-make-dairy-proposal-that-canada-flatly-rejects\">end Canada’s dairy system</a>, and another to increase the percentage of U.S.-made parts that must be used in cars imported from Mexico and Canada, which Foreign Minister <strong>Chrystia Freeland</strong> said would “put tens of thousands of jobs at risk.” Freeland was also skeptical of the proposal to insert a five-year “sunset clause” that would automatically end the agreement unless all parties decide to renew it, and she denounced the U.S.’s “winner-takes-all mindset,” saying the proposals from Team Trump would “undermine, rather than modernize, the agreement.” &quot;In some cases, these proposals run counter to World Trade Organization rules,” she <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nafta-freeland-lighthizer-round4-1.4358242\">said</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/920394355000729602\">adding</a> that Canadians should prepare in a “no-fuss Canadian way for the worst possible outcome.”</p>\n<p>For its part, the U.S. claimed to be shocked that Canada and Mexico wouldn’t want to go along with a deal that would hurt their countries. “We have seen no indication that our partners are willing to make any changes that will result in a rebalancing and a reduction in these huge trade deficits,” U.S. trade representative <strong>Robert Lighthizer</strong> said. Meanwhile, Trump, who appears to make policy decisions based on whatever gets the most applause at his campaign-style rallies, is seemingly happy to blowup the agreement, with several reports suggesting he’s been pushing these ridiculous demands <em>in order</em> to jeopardize the deal.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>It was a big day for racists and Holocaust deniers on the fringes of the finance industry</strong></p>\n<p>On the same day that <strong>Anthony Scaramucci’s</strong> new media venture <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/scaramucci-post-holocaust-poll\">issued an apology</a> “if anyone was offended” by a Twitter poll asking how many Jews died in the Holocaust, investor/markets commenter <strong>Marc Faber,</strong> a.k.a. Dr. Doom, has come under fire for a passage in his latest newsletter that said, basically, that the U.S. is great because white people are in charge. Writing that he didn’t want to “enter into a serious discussion of the tearing down of monuments of historical personalities,” Faber told his subscribers, “Thank God white people populated America, and not the blacks. Otherwise, the US would look like Zimbabwe, which it might look like one day anyway, but at least America enjoyed 200 years in the economic and political sun under a white majority. I am not a racist, but the reality&#8212;no matter how politically incorrect&#8212;needs to be spelled out as well.” When contacted by <em>Business Insider</em> about the commentary, Faber <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/marc-faber-investment-letter-white-people-blacks-confederate-statues-2017-10\">responded</a>, “I am naturally standing by this comment since this is an undisputable fact.” He added in an e-mail to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/17/dr-doom-faber-thank-god-white-people-populated-america.html\">CNBC</a>: “If stating some historical facts makes me a racist, then I suppose that I am a racist.”</p>\n<p>Faber, who has previously discussed <a href=\"http://www.marcfabernews.com/2010/01/marc-faber-on-prostitutes-and-beer-and.html#.WeZfYtOGOi4\">using hookers</a> and had a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter shadow him <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB885490333571894500\">at a Hong Kong girlie bar</a> where he complained about the price of beer, has been forced to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/17/asset-manager-sprott-says-marc-faber-has-resigned-from-board.html\">resign</a> from the board of Canadian asset manager Faber and has been banned from appearing on CNBC, Fox Business, and Bloomberg TV.</p>\n<p><strong>Happy Dow 23,000 Day</strong></p>\n<p>Congratulations to everyone who invested in hats.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/carlquintanilla/status/920309892157763584\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/carlquintanilla/status/920309892157763584\">https://twitter.com/carlquintanilla/status/920309892157763584</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Unsurprisingly, the president marked the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossing the 23,000 mark for the first time on his Twitter feed, despite the fact that he probably had very little to do with the milestone. As <em>The Atlantic</em> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/10/trump-stock-market/543162/\">points out</a>, “In the past year, there’s been little radical change to the broad policies that can impact the market, including fiscal and monetary policy,” and a lot of the uptick in the market “has been in the works for the past decade, when the recovery finally kicked in in 2009.”</p>\n<p><strong>Frankfurters don’t want Brexit bankers moving there, either</strong></p>\n<p>In the wake of the U.K.’s decision to withdraw from the European Union and become a xenophobic backwoods, global banks with a presence in London&#8212;which is to say, virtually all of them&#8212;must find new homes for thousands of employees. While Paris, Dublin, and Frankfurt have all been jockeying to become the next finance center of Europe, bankers have privately bemoaned the prospect of moving to “Yawnfurt,” with one telling <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-17/why-frankfurt-says-london-can-keep-its-bankers-after-brexit\">Bloomberg</a> that his family will stay in the U.K. and he’ll try to limit his time in the German city to a few days a week. And as it turns out, the locals aren’t too enthused about the situation either.</p>\n<p>“Brexit will be very bad for people with a normal income,” <strong>Micha Hintz,</strong> an owner of a Karl Marx bookstore told reporters <strong>Steven Arons</strong> and <strong>Alessandro Speciale.</strong> “It may be good for the city’s international competitiveness, but what we need is affordable housing. And the population has no voice in this.” Or as <strong>Tobias Schmitz</strong> put it: “Frankfurt would be better off if more banks opted for Paris instead.”</p>\n<p><strong>Local man has no regrets about selling his family’s home, possessions to invest in Bitcoin</strong></p>\n<p>We look forward to <strong>Jamie Dimon’s</strong> next conference call being <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/jamie-dimon-bitcoin-stupid\">entirely devoted</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/17/this-family-bet-it-all-on-bitcoin.html\">this guy</a>, who we can only assume the JPMorgan C.E.O. will refer to as a “mouthbreather.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Didi Taihuttu,</strong> his wife, three kids, and their cat bet all they have on bitcoin. The Dutch family of five is in the process of selling pretty much everything they own&#8212;from their 2,500-square-foot house, to their shoes&#8212;and trading it in for the popular cryptocurrency. They have moved to a campsite in the Netherlands, where they’re waiting for bitcoin to really take off.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s only been a few months, but the 39-year-old father of three says he doesn’t regret a thing. “We were just like&#8212;sell it, sell it, what can we lose? Yeah, we can lose all the material stuff. Yeah, we can lose all our money. Yeah, we don’t have three cars anymore. We don’t have the motorcycle anymore. But in the end, I think we, as a family, will still be happy and just enjoying life.”</p>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>Tax Overhaul Off to Rocky Start as Senators Bicker Over Budget (<a

now, pretty much every sentient being on the planet knows Mark Zuckerberg’s story: He grew up in White Plains, New York. His dad was a dentist; his mom, a psychiatrist. He was a stellar student and went to Harvard. He studied code and ancient Greek poetry, and one night, he created something he later called thefacebook.com and then just Facebook. There was a little legal spat with these two really tall twin brothers, and then Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher made a movie, and Jesse Eisenberg played him, and Trent Reznor composed the soundtrack. And then they I.P.O.’d.\n<p>Today, Mark Zuckerberg is the undisputed King of Tech and one of the most important innovators ever. He’s also worth some $50 billion, almost all of which he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have pledged to charity.</p>\n<p>Probably more than anyone else in the Internet Age, Zuckerberg embodies The Type: the lanky, introverted geek who focuses laser-like on some new gizmo he’s been secretly building and then, seemingly overnight, becomes the most important person on earth. The Type doesn’t need a college degree and doesn’t think much of fashion. That’s why he wears the same T-shirt every day&#8212;the better to focus on his next app or site or whatever.</p>\n<p>There were antecedents to Zuckerberg, most obviously Bill Gates, but none of the people who came before him enjoyed the same platform, the same power to project their image on the world. And none of them created a new language for communicating with strangers everywhere. Today, billions of people across the globe like, share, post, and react to content because Zuck imagined it. Billions of people spend countless hours “friending” friends and non-friends alike. Everyone is connected now. That is Zuckerberg’s legacy. His first, at least.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/25/5745d8cf614dc9a45cb0b41f_hive-contributor-profile-mark-zuckerberg.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 25, 2016 12:54 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-mark-zuckerberg.jpg","_embedded":{"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[]},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-mark-zuckerberg.jpg","credit":"By David Ramos/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5745d8cfc1f81aa45c811831","createdAt":"May 25, 2016 12:54 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 25, 2016 12:54 pm","description":"Getty: 511709422","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/mark-zuckerberg","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/25/5745d8cf614dc9a45cb0b41f_hive-contributor-profile-mark-zuckerberg.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 25, 2016 12:54 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-mark-zuckerberg.jpg","_embedded":{"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[]},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-mark-zuckerberg.jpg","credit":"By David Ramos/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5745d8cfc1f81aa45c811831","createdAt":"May 25, 2016 12:54 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 25, 2016 12:54 pm","description":"Getty: 511709422","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"5745d882b09823be03ef3d57","revision":3,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/mark-zuckerberg"},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"revisionAuthor":"Emma Stefansky","hed":"Mark Zuckerberg Asks Forgiveness for His “Mistakes” on Facebook","body":"<p><strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> has been under fire ever since Election Day, mostly for doing nothing to combat the onslaught of fake news posts shared on Facebook&#8212;many of which were allegedly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/facebooks-russian-rabbit-hole-keeps-going-deeper\">written by Russian bloggers</a> hoping to influence the outcome of the vote.

Zuckerberg, after all, was only 21 years old at the time. But aside from his youthfulness, the truly fascinating element about this time-capsule video, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--APdD6vejI\">other interviews</a> he gave during the early days of Facebook, is how naïve he appears about his own brainchild.</p>\n<p>In his conversation with MarketWatch, Zuckerberg nonchalantly explained his early decision to localize the way people used Facebook&#8212;to allow only people from specific colleges to sign up for the service and to restrict their network to people from that college. This limiting factor, he explained, “made it so people were comfortable sharing information that they probably would not have otherwise.” These privacy settings, in other words, made people feel safe enough to share personal and private things with Facebook.</p>\n<p>A year later, however, Facebook abandoned the college-only rule, and made it so that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2006/09/26/facebook-just-launched-open-registrations/\">anyone could sign up for an account</a>. There was, of course, an uproar. Nevertheless, more people signed up. And they continued to sign up. Now, a quarter of the planet is on the service.</p>\n<p>What’s staggering, in retrospect, is that a 21-year-old kid in flip-flops and surf shorts was making decisions back then that would set the stage for Russians to hack our election process a decade later. It’s stupefying to see how our eroded privacy (which we all happily signed up for, indeed) coupled with targeting tools built by Facebook, became the printing press for fake news, which was then targeted to the most insecure voters in the country. There are similar interviews from the same time period, it is also worth noting, when a young <strong>Jack Dorsey</strong>&#8212;a nose ring cupping his nostril, his hair scraggly&#8212;talked with his co-founders about Twttr (yes, there was a pre-vowels era) and all the innocent ways his service could be used to chat with your friends and make party plans.</p>\n<p>While it would be easy to blame the younger iterations of these C.E.O.s for the world we now find ourselves in today (I do think the venture capitalists, specifically people like <strong>Peter Thiel,</strong> who initially funded Facebook, and <strong>Marc Andreessen,</strong> who sits on the board, deserve some blame for not questioning the negative possibilities of these decisions earlier), a more apt question is how we can stop these things, or likely worse scenarios, from happening in the future, not only at these specific companies, but also with other technologies that are being built by young engineers in Silicon Valley today.</p>\n<p>For example, we’re barreling headfirst into a world of driverless cars, which will have innumerable positive impacts on society, including reducing car accidents and fatalities that result from human error. But, what are people doing to ensure that these cars can’t be hacked and turned into weapons, used to kill people who are protesting, or even walking down the street minding their own business? Or what if the Russians one day hacked into a driverless car networks and sent all of the Democratic voters to the wrong precinct, making them illegible to vote? It doesn’t take much of an imagination to envision how a sky full of delivery drones, upcoming audio and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/fake-news-technology\">video technologies</a>, and a slew of other start-up ideas could be used against us.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Facebook and Twitter have both come around to the manner in which their platforms have been hijacked by bad actors, but the antecedents of the problems were largely financial. Facebook currently <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/facebook-spent-more-on-lobbying-in-the-first-quarter-of-2017-than-any--2370994276.html\">spends more than $3 million a quarter</a> on lobbying efforts in Washington, but back in 2011, the company lobbied the F.E.C. to block rules that required displaying the sponsor of a political ad. Facebook <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/why-facebook-will-struggle-to-regulate-political-ads/\">argued</a> that the ads were so small, almost like “bumper stickers, which don’t require any kind of disclosure.” In hindsight, that doesn’t seem to have been such a good idea. When I was at an event at Harvard University shortly after the election, <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> senior campaign staffers were bragging that they didn’t have the kind of money that <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> had at her disposal, so they were forced to use Facebook, which even back then, they knew was drastically more effective than a TV ad. Twitter didn’t eradicate its trolls; doing so would have diminished its already paltry user growth. Again, good for the company’s bottom-line, bad idea for our democracy.</p>\n<p>When I bring this recent history up to people in Silicon Valley, they defend these companies (and the people who build them), saying that technology is just a tool that can be used for good or evil. Most people use a hammer, after all, to build a house, or hang a picture frame on the wall. A small selection of bad people use them as weapons. I understand this argument, but technology also allows its founder to prevent their brainchild form being weaponized. Additionally, these “tools” aren’t just dumb objects, like a hammer. They are smart, with algorithms that can do things that humans can do (and in some instances, can not), by helping find like-minded people on a network, or seeing what they are interested in, or what they fear.</p>\n<p>Which of course brings us to the scariest technology of all. What everyone in Silicon Valley sees as the next big thing, artificial intelligence. There are plenty of incredibly smart people who have sounded the alarm about what could go wrong with A.I., <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/elon-musk-billion-dollar-crusade-to-stop-ai-space-x\">including</a> <strong>Elon Musk</strong> and <strong>Stephen Hawking,</strong> and yet people are building it as you read these words, without oversight and possibly even understanding. Clearly, <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> has seen the power of technology, with the influence he played in both the U.S. election and Brexit in the United Kingdom. And he knows full well that A.I. isn’t just a tool, but rather, as he noted earlier this month, “the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind,” and that “whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” Off course, it’s the C.E.O. of one of the most powerful companies on the planet, Mark Zuckerberg, who <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/24/mark-zuckerberg-elon-musks-doomsday-ai-predictions-are-irresponsible.html\">doesn’t think</a> it’s a threat at

president tossing rolls of paper towels, free-throw style</a>, into a crowd of hurricane survivors, <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> created his own completely avoidable public-relations disaster Monday when he chose to demonstrate Facebook’s new Facebook Spaces app&#8212;which lets users explore real destinations as Wii-like cartoon avatars&#8212;in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>Donning an Oculus Rift headset, Zuckerberg and <strong>Rachel Franklin,</strong> Facebook’s head of social V.R., embarked on a “magical” tour of the devastated island&#8212;where many residents are still without electrical power and much-needed food and supplies&#8212;in an attempt to explain how Facebook Spaces related to Facebook’s disaster relief efforts. “We’re in a 360 video in Puerto Rico . . . we’re on a bridge here, it’s flooded,” grinning cartoon Zuckerberg said in the Facebook Live video. “You can get a sense of some of the damage here that the hurricanes have done, and one of the things that’s really magical about virtual reality is you can get the feeling that you’re really in a place.” The background video, provided by NPR, featured flooded streets and Puerto Ricans clearing their homes of debris.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to connect Facebook’s newest feature to its humanitarian efforts, he added that the company is “very focused on trying to help out in the recovery effort.” The social-media giant enabled its Safety Check feature and community assistance features in Puerto Rico, a disembodied cartoon avatar of Zuckerberg explained, adding that the company was working with the Red Cross to construct satellite imagery to help direct volunteers and aid workers to different parts of the island.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the backlash on social media was swift. “The awful taste of this demo shows how far out of his depth Zuckerberg is running Facebook,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/917605971962335232\">one Twitter user said</a>. “Need

It’s a huge reversal for the social-media platform, which had resisted sharing such information broadly, citing concerns about advertisers’ privacy. The company’s general counsel <strong>Colin Stretch</strong> made the announcement <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/09/providing-congress-with-ads-linked-to-internet-research-agency/\">on Thursday</a> just as <strong>Mark Zuckerberg,</strong> on his first day back from paternity leave following the birth of his second daughter, conducted a brief livestream on Facebook to discuss the decision and Facebook’s next steps.</p>\n<p>Facebook’s decision to share information with the House and Senate intelligence committees, which are investigating Russian interference during the 2016 election, comes less than a day after Twitter confirmed it would also <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/twitter-confirms-it-is-cooperating-with-the-russia-probe\">cooperate</a> with the government’s Russia probe. “We believe it is vitally important that government authorities have the information they need to deliver to the public a full assessment of what happened in the 2016 election,” Stretch wrote in a blog post. “That is an assessment that can be made only by investigators with access to classified intelligence and information from all relevant companies and industries&#8212;and we want to do our part.”</p>\n<p>Zuckerberg, who was initially dismissive of the idea that his social-media empire might have been manipulated to influence the election’s outcome, said in a rare Facebook Live video on Thursday that Facebook would implement a nine-step plan in the coming months to help safeguard the integrity of elections around the world. “I care deeply about the democratic process and protecting its integrity. . . . I don’t want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy,” he said. “That’s not what we stand for. . . . As we’ve shared before, our teams have found and shut down thousands of fake accounts that could be attempting to influence elections in may other countries, including most recently in the French elections. . . . There will always be bad actors in the world. . . . We can make it harder [for them], and that’s what we’re going to focus on doing.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed facebook-embed-component embed block row social-facebook\" data-type=\"facebook\"><div class=\"fb-post\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/vb.4/10104052858820231\"></div></div><p>Soon, Zuckerberg said, Facebook users will be able to visit advertisers’ pages to see what they’re advertising, and who they’re targeting. Facebook will also add disclosures to political ads specifying who paid for them. The company will expand its partnerships with election commissions worldwide and share information about existing threats to elections. It will also share such information with other companies.</p>\n<p>The major new effort will require a small army of staff to guard against the kind of cyber psy-ops that Russia deployed so effectively last year. Facebook will add 250 employees in the next year to help strengthen election-integrity initiatives, doubling its existing workforce in that area. And the effort is already underway: Zuckerberg said Facebook has taken action against fake Facebook accounts leading up to the German elections this weekend, though he noted that Facebook hasn’t detected evidence of Russian interference like the company found after the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.</p>\n<p>Facebook has been scrambling to defuse its mounting P.R. crisis amid news that the F.B.I. is zeroing in on the role that social media played in Russia’s election meddling.

Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-13/mueller-probe-is-said-to-have-red-hot-focus-on-social-media\">reports</a> that special counsel <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> team of prosecutors are investigating how Russia manipulated social media to post propaganda and spread fake-news stories, and are “seeking additional evidence” from companies like Twitter and Facebook. The latest revelation follows <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/facebook-says-it-sold-political-ads-to-russian-company-during-2016-election/2017/09/06/32f01fd2-931e-11e7-89fa-bb822a46da5b_story.html?utm_term=.c125c3a5341c\">news</a> last week that Facebook turned over information to congressional investigators showing that it sold about $100,000 worth of ads&#8212;a relatively small amount of ad spend, but one that nevertheless could have reached <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/russias-facebook-fake-news-could-have-reached-70-million-americans\">70 million</a> Facebook users&#8212;to a shady pro-Kremlin Russian propaganda company seeking to target U.S. voters.</p>\n<p>It’s a remarkable turn of events for C.E.O. <strong>Mark Zuckerberg,</strong> who had previously called it “pretty crazy” that Facebook could have had a material impact on the election. In the last several months however, new fears about cyber warfare, including Russia’s sophisticated propaganda machine, have moved from the intelligence community into the mainstream. On Monday, the Daily Beast <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/how-russia-turned-americans-into-weapons-in-its-information-war\">reported</a> that Russian operatives also sought to organize conservative protests in the U.S., using false identities to create Facebook events designed to inflame partisan divisions over immigration and Islam. According to Bloomberg, multiple agencies including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the F.B.I. are now racing to prevent future hacking and disinformation operations, including potential threats to the 2018 midterm elections.</p>\n<p>Facebook is also rushing to fix what threatens to become a major P.R. issue. Over the past week, Facebook has said it will shut off advertisements for news outlets publishing misinformation; that it will take new precautions when placing ads inside videos; and that it will be more responsive to advertisers in not pairing them with content “that wouldn’t reflect well on their brands.” Its <a href=\"https://media.fb.com/2017/09/13/standards-and-guidelines-for-earning-money-from-your-content-on-facebook/\">new guidelines</a> for publishers that want to run ads, for instance, demand an “authentic, established presence on Facebook” and proof that “they are who they represent themselves to be, and have had a profile or page on Facebook for at least one month.” Facebook also said that it has now shut down all inauthentic accounts and pages believed to be operated out of Russia. The response comes after Facebook <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/27/facebook-to-fight-fake-news-groups.html\">said</a> earlier this year that it would add new services to detect abuse and fake accounts on its platforms, and take down what it calls “false amplifiers”&#8212;fake accounts or groups that coordinate online harassment campaigns or spread fake news.</p>\n<p>The mounting scrutiny comes at a precarious time for Facebook and other major Silicon Valley companies, which are quickly seeing their political firewall in Washington eroded. For years, the Big Five tech oligopoly (Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet) has managed to stay off Congress’s radar, ensconced in a halo of consumer goodwill that has mostly protected them from the sorts of regulatory threats that have resulted in anti-trust investigations and large fines in Europe. Now, the Era of Good Feelings seems to be coming to an end, just as the federal government is taking a harder look at the ways in which social-media platforms were weaponized in 2016. Suspicion of Facebook is a bipartisan enterprise; Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman <strong>Richard Burr,</strong> a North Carolina Republican, has said that it’s “probably more of a question of when” than if Facebook officials will have to testify. The committee’s top Democrat, Senator <strong>Mark Warner,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/9/12/16296038/facebook-twitter-testify-congress-russia-interference-2016-trump-clinton\">argued</a> this week that “the whole notion of social media and how it is used in political campaigns is the wild wild west.” He added that Facebook’s earlier denials “in the immediate aftermath of our elections” raises questions about what they knew, and when they knew. (Facebook said in a statement that “we have shared our findings with U.S. authorities investigating these issues, and we will continue to work with them as necessary.”)</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["mark zuckerberg","facebook","russia","mueller","investigation","misinformation"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"With Mueller bearing down and Congress demanding answers, Silicon Valley is losing its political firewall.","seoTitle":"Mark Zuckerberg’s Russia Problem Is Bigger Than Facebook","seoDescription":"With Mueller bearing down and Congress demanding answers, Silicon Valley is losing its political firewall.","socialTitle":"Mark Zuckerberg’s Russia Problem Is Bigger Than Facebook","socialDescription":"With Mueller bearing down and Congress demanding answers, Silicon Valley is losing its political firewall.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Facebook","promoHed":"Mark Zuckerberg’s Russia Problem Is Bigger Than Facebook","promoDek":"With Mueller bearing down and Congress demanding answers, Silicon Valley is losing its political firewall.","id":"59ba8a1740720e757f0e27ca","revision":2,"createdAt":"September 14, 2017 9:54 am","modifiedAt":"September 14, 2017 10:03 am","revisionCreatedAt":"September 14, 2017 10:03 am","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Benjamin Landy","filename":"mark-zuckerberg.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/04/27/59021fc166498c1bfe5eab29_mark-zuckerberg.jpg"}},"title":"mark-zuckerberg-facebook","credit":"By Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"59021fc166498c1bfe5eab2a","revision":1,"createdAt":"April 27, 2017 12:43 pm","modifiedAt":"April 27, 2017 12:44 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"April 27, 2017 12:44 pm","tags":[],"altText":"mark-zuckerberg-facebook","description":"Getty not 250 #669889770","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Zac Frank","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

While some were quick to blame Facebook for amplifying misinformation about <strong>Hillary Clinton,</strong> Zuckerberg suggested that critics were betraying a “profound lack of empathy” by not taking voters who supported <strong>Donald Trump</strong> seriously.</p>\n<p>Zuckerberg wasn’t wrong to be skeptical of Democrats assigning blame rather than engaging in self-reflection. But in dismissing the possibility that social media might be anything other than a force for good, Zuckerberg was also slow to recognize Facebook’s own vulnerabilities in an age of information warfare. About a week after the Techonomy conference, however, Zuckerberg received a “wake-up call” from President <strong>Barack Obama,</strong> <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-tried-to-give-zuckerberg-a-wake-up-call-over-fake-news-on-facebook/2017/09/24/15d19b12-ddac-4ad5-ac6e-ef909e1c1284_story.html?utm_term=.f70f7bbd387f\">reports</a>. During a meeting of world leaders in Lima, Peru, nine days after the election, Obama tried to personally appeal to Zuckerberg, warning that unless Facebook did something, its fake-news problem would only be exacerbated in the next presidential election:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For months leading up to the vote, Obama and his top aides quietly agonized over how to respond to Russia’s brazen intervention on behalf of the Donald Trump campaign without making matters worse. Weeks after Trump’s surprise victory, some of Obama’s aides looked back with regret and wished they had done more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zuckerberg acknowledged the problem posed by fake news. But he told Obama that those messages weren’t widespread on Facebook and that there was no easy remedy, according to people briefed on the exchange, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details of a private conversation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The account of Zuckerberg’s post-election reckoning also reveals new details about what Facebook executives knew, and when they knew it. The <em>Post</em> reports that Facebook notified the F.B.I. as early as June 2016 when a hacking group working in connection to the GRU, the Russian military intelligence unit, started making fake Facebook profiles to disseminate stolen e-mails and manipulate public opinion&#8212;days before Guccifer 2.0, a hacking persona now thought to be a front for Russian intelligence, took credit for hacking the Democratic National Committee. But after looking into the accounts, which were linked to the GRU’s hacking group called APT28 or Fancy Bear, which set up a Facebook profile for Guccifer 2.0 and a Facebook page called DCLeaks, the company came to believe they weren’t linked to a foreign government but were instead financially motivated.</p>\n<p>It took months for Facebook to publicly acknowledge what was clear to the Obama administration much earlier. Now, nearly a year after the election, Zuckerberg has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/mark-zuckerberg-backtracks-as-his-russia-problem-spirals\">backtracked</a> on his initial dismissals about fake news. Last week, amid bipartisan congressional furor over what some lawmakers said was Facebook’s unwillingness to share information about Russian interference, Zuckerberg announced online that Facebook would be handing congressional investigators more than 3,000 ads it believes were purchased by a Russian troll farm from 2015 to 2017; he conceded that Facebook had been manipulated during the election; and outlined nine steps he says Facebook will be taking to ensure election interference can’t happen on its platform in the future.</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["facebook","mark zuckerberg","russian","barack obama","election interference","2016 election"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Facebook found evidence of Russian interference as early as June 2016&#8212;but didn’t recognize the magnitude of the threat.","seoTitle":"Zuckerberg Brushed Off Obama’s Private Warnings About Facebook","seoDescription":"Facebook found evidence of Russian interference as early as June 2016—but didn’t recognize the magnitude of the threat.","socialTitle":"Zuckerberg Brushed Off Obama’s Private Warnings About Facebook","socialDescription":"Facebook found evidence of Russian interference as early as June 2016—but didn’t recognize the magnitude of the threat.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Facebook","promoHed":"Zuckerberg Brushed Off Obama’s Private Warnings About Facebook","promoDek":"Facebook found evidence of Russian interference as early as June 2016&#8212;but didn’t recognize the magnitude of the threat.","id":"59c8f9503d8edb5fbd6dbf6b","revision":2,"createdAt":"September 25, 2017 8:40 am","modifiedAt":"September 25, 2017 9:18 am","revisionCreatedAt":"September 25, 2017 9:18 am","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","filename":"GettyImages-142385209.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":989,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/09/25/59c90196a7823e560061b760_GettyImages-142385209.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":987,"width":658,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":987,"width":658,"x":391,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":976,"width":549,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":976,"width":549,"x":445.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":615,"width":1435,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":615,"width":1435,"x":2.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":810,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":810,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":987,"width":1316,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":987,"width":1316,"x":62,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":989,"width":989,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":989,"width":989,"x":225.5,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"US President Barack Obama speaks as Face","description":"250: 142385209","caption":"","credit":"By Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images.","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"59c90196a7823e560061b761","revision":1,"createdAt":"September 25, 2017 9:16 am","modifiedAt":"September 25, 2017 9:16 am","revisionCreatedAt":"September 25, 2017 9:16 am","tags":[],"altText":"US President Barack Obama speaks as Face","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Zac Frank","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

Days after <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/trump-is-back-to-calling-russian-election-interference-a-hoax\">dismissing</a> the uproar over Russian “ads on Facebook” as part of a larger “Russia hoax,” the president took more direct aim at the social network in a tweet, baselessly accusing Facebook of unspecified “collusion” with major newspapers, and television networks during the election.</p>\n<p>“Facebook was always anti-Trump.The Networks were always anti-Trump hence, Fake News, @nytimes(apologized) &amp; @WaPo were anti-Trump. Collusion?” he wrote, following up with a familiar boastful refrain about his election victory. “..But the people were Pro-Trump! Virtually no President has accomplished what we have accomplished in the first 9 months-and economy roaring.”</p>\n<p>The sudden attack fits a broader pattern of Trump lashing out at anyone or anything that he deems to threaten his legitimacy. Even after taking office, Trump has repeatedly derided the U.S. intelligence community for its conclusion that the Kremlin worked to tip the election in his favor, and has taken any insinuation to that effect to be an insult. Trump’s Russia trigger is one of several political trip wires that Zuckerberg has had to navigate as his company comes under increased scrutiny for not doing more to combat Russian propagandists on its platform last year. Facing blowback from lawmakers, Zuckerberg announced in a livestream last week that Facebook would turn over 3,000 ads to Congress that it believes were purchased by a Russian propaganda outlet with the intention of targeting U.S. voters. In doing so, he may have solved one political crisis while creating another.</p>\n<p>It’s exactly the sort of debacle that Zuckerberg had once sought to avoid. As <em>The Washington Post</em> reported this week, the 33-year-old billionaire had previously brushed off warnings from former President <strong>Barack Obama</strong>  about the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/zuckerberg-brushed-off-obamas-private-warnings-about-facebook\">vulnerabilities</a> of Facebook’s platform after the election last year. But shifting political winds have blown Zuckerberg straight into the Russia maelstrom. Mueller is said to have a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-13/mueller-probe-is-said-to-have-red-hot-focus-on-social-media\">“red-hot” focus</a> on the role social media, including Facebook, played in the Russian campaign, and Democrats are now asking the F.E.C. to <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-russia-investigation-fec-political-ads-2017-9\">regulate</a> online political ads in the wake of Facebook’s admissions.</p>\n<p>Intelligence experts have described Russia’s cyber campaign as a sophisticated attack on the U.S. electoral system. Russian operatives reportedly created thousands of fake profiles on social-media Web sites like Facebook to sow chaos and misinformation, as well as exacerbate existing partisan divisions on social media. The Democratic National Committee, <strong>Hillary Clinton’s</strong> campaign, and voter databases and software systems in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/russia-may-have-hacked-elections-systems-in-39-states\">39 states</a> were all compromised. To the extent that Trump views Mueller’s investigation as a personal affront, he likely views Zuckerberg’s cooperation as another slight.</p>\n<p>Trump, of course, wasn’t always so anti-Facebook; in January 2016, he was more than happy to tweet a <em>USA Today</em> story claiming that he generated more discussion on Facebook than all other candidates in the weeks before.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/692093970034343936\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/692093970034343936\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/692093970034343936</a></p></blockquote></div>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["donald trump","facebook","new york times","washington post","collusion","russia"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"And insinuates that the social network was engaged in “collusion” with the media during the election.","seoTitle":"Trump Slams Zuckerberg: “Facebook Was Always Anti-Trump”","seoDescription":"And insinuates that the social network was engaged in “collusion” with the media during the election.","socialTitle":"Trump Slams Zuckerberg: “Facebook Was Always Anti-Trump”","socialDescription":"And insinuates that the social network was engaged in “collusion” with the media during the election.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Facebook","promoHed":"Trump Slams Zuckerberg: “Facebook Was Always Anti-Trump”","promoDek":"And insinuates that the social network was engaged in “collusion” with the media during the election.","id":"59cbed1c6a848b44d4891343","revision":2,"createdAt":"September 27, 2017 2:25 pm","modifiedAt":"September 27, 2017 2:29 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"September 27, 2017 2:29 pm","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","filename":"Trump-Zuckerberg-FB.png","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"PNG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/09/27/59cbed46280c245e6232b3d6_Trump-Zuckerberg-FB.png"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":640,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":640,"x":400,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":540,"x":450,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":615,"width":1435,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":615,"width":1435,"x":2.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":810,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":810,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1280,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1280,"x":80,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":960,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":960,"x":240,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"Trump-Zuckerberg-FB.png","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"59cbed46280c245e6232b3d7","revision":1,"createdAt":"September 27, 2017 2:26 pm","modifiedAt":"September 27, 2017 2:26 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"September 27, 2017 2:26 pm","credit":"Left, by Alex Wong/Getty Images; Right, by David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images.","tags":[],"altText":"","description":"Getty; 854236396, 669913922","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Zac Frank","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

It’s wide and rectangular, painted the iconic Facebook blue, and smack in the middle, framed by a ground covering of red mulch, is the renowned Facebook thumbs-up icon. That sign, like Facebook, has become famous beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. Tourists visiting San Francisco make the hour-long pilgrimage down to Hacker Way to see the sign in person. Some take selfies in front of it, others stand next to it and imitate the ascending digit. That sign is also something of a metaphor: it’s the line that separates where employees can go&#8212;inside the highly secure, Tetris-like buildings that make up Facebook’s headquarters&#8212;and the public cannot. It’s the border between Facebook’s public image and its own vision of itself.</p>\n<p>These days, that is fraught territory. A rift is starting to develop between the people who work for Facebook, and those who simply use the platform. Countless people who live and work in Silicon Valley, and even some ex-Facebook employees, complain that Facebook employees are increasingly living in a bubble. They are sharing stories and theories that <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> is surrounded by sycophants and people who think just like him; that he’s unaware of the negative impact his company has had on the world and doesn’t fully appreciate the extent to which Facebook was weaponized during the election. (Zuckerberg’s countrywide itinerary, featuring folksy images of himself engaging with regular Americans, didn’t precisely dissuade people from the assumption that he isn’t getting honest feedback from deputies.)</p>\n<p>Like many C.E.O.s, Zuckerberg does run the risk of being aloof. In particular, Zuckerberg has few friends outside of Facebook. Beyond the time he spends with his wife and young children, he does very little that doesn’t, in some way, point back to his work at <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/how-young-mark-zuckerberg-paved-the-way-for-the-russians\">the company he runs</a>. This sort of discipline becomes problematic when you learn that some of the people who surround Zuckerberg on a daily basis&#8212;the vast majority being current Facebook employees&#8212;seem to think (like Zuckerberg) that most of the Russian involvement in the election is overblown and that the company is being used as a scapegoat for a dysfunctional country that has been polarized by the media and broken by inept politicians. They argue (sometimes publicly, but mostly privately) that a small percentage of people actually saw the ads purchased by the Russians, that the company simply can’t be held responsible for where we find ourselves today. Mark Zuckerberg tends to agree.</p>\n<p>It’s clear that <strong>Sheryl Sandberg</strong> is trying to come up with some sort of balance between admitting the role Facebook played, and downplaying when the company realized it was at fault. “Things happened on our platform that shouldn’t have happened,” Sandberg acknowledged Thursday in an <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/exclusive-interview-facebook-sheryl-sandberg-2495538841.html\">interview</a> with Axios’s <strong>Mike Allen.</strong> Sandberg also said Facebook is not a news organization, and in an attempt to shirk the responsibility the company has to determine what is real and accurate on the social network, noted, “at our heart we’re a tech company . . . we don’t hire journalists.” But last year, Pew Research put out a report noting that 44 percent of Americans get their news from Facebook.</p>\n<p>The public, including venture capitalists, engineers, and the C.E.O.s of other companies, even former Facebook employees, all of whom I’ve spoken with in recent weeks, see things differently. “Most of the early employees I know are totally overwhelmed by what this thing has become,” an early ex-Facebook employee told me recently, referring to the size of the social network and the gargantuan impact it now has on the way people think and communicate. “They look at the role Facebook now plays in society, and how Russia used it during the election to elect Trump, and they have this sort of ‘Oh my God, what have I done’ moment.” Other early ex-employees have privately voiced similar feelings to me, and they’ve also expressed concerns that the people who still work there get defensive when they try to bring up these concerns. “I lay awake at night thinking about all the things we built in the early days and what we could have done to avoid the product being used this way,” the early ex-employee told me.</p>\n<p>When I speak to other people who personally know Zuckerberg and socialize with several high-level employees, they voice frustrations about the response they hear from engineers and executives at the company&#8212;at least, the response they have heard until Sandberg finally spoke up. Some internally argue there’s not much the social giant could do to stop propaganda being shared on the site (even Sandberg’s “we’re not a media company” argument is a version of this refrain); others say that the ads only affected a small number of people out of billions who use the site. “They have their head in the sand like Mark,” one person said, before noting what we all know about Russia’s influence through the site: “Of course it was impactful.” Another Valley insider who personally knows Zuckerberg noted that while Facebook has been historically successful financially, the company is fundamentally “immature” with respect to its mission and the comprehension of its impact. And then there are those who point out that while the ads may have only reached a small group of people, Trump won the electoral college by a small number of votes, too.</p>\n<p>The criticism may not be getting through. Some worry that Zuckerberg is surrounded by sycophants, which may be why the poorly conceived publicity stunts continue. On Monday, Zuckerberg and a colleague <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/zuckerberg-slammed-for-tone-deaf-virtual-reality-tour-of-devastated-puerto-rico\">donned</a> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/09/oculus-rift-mark-zuckerberg-cover-story-palmer-luckey\">Oculus headsets</a> and met in virtual reality to discuss the new technologies the company has been working on. An animated version of Zuckerberg, looking very much like Microsoft’s famous Clippy paper clip, but with hair, waved its lanky arms as they traveled the virtual globe. The stunt was pretty uneventful until a smiling Clippy Zuckerberg was superimposed over footage of disaster zones in Puerto Rico, an experience he cheerily described as “magical” as people waded through the floodwaters behind him. Like his highly choreographed Great American Road Trip, Zuckerberg’s virtual tour suggests an executive more comfortable seeing people as abstract concepts. People who know Zuckerberg think he’s losing touch with what it’s like to suffer real loss, and that he’s on his way to becoming a modern-day Howard Hughes, insulated from the real world.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>What most of those tourists who come down to Facebook to pose in front of the thumbs-up sign don’t realize is that they are actually looking at the back of another sign. On the reverse side is the logo for Sun Microsystems, the company which once occupied the campus where Facebook now resides. Sun, as you might remember, suffered colossal losses from the dot-com boom and was eventually forced to sell itself. When the social network moved into its new headquarters in 2011, Mark Zuckerberg said that the Sun sign should be flipped around, and that the back should be left as-is to remind Facebook employees what can happen to a company when they take their eye off the ball.</p>\n<p>There are, of course, plenty of people who are willing to come to Zuckerberg’s defense, including some former employees, and&#8212;wouldn’t you know&#8212;many current ones. One person told me that Zuckerberg was really shaken by what took place during the election, and legitimately wants to avoid it from happening again. But, at the same time, his ambitions (yes, he’s nowhere near happy with just a quarter of the planet on Facebook) stand in the way of how much he will actually do to affect change. There’s also the reality that at the end of the day, as with all things, it comes down to money. Politics is a big cash cow for Facebook’s revenue. On <em>60 Minutes</em> this week, <strong>Brad Parscale,</strong> the political media strategist who directed Donald Trump’s digital campaign, bragged that there were Facebook employees who were at Trump campaign offices several days a week, teaching Parscale and others how to most effectively use the Facebook platform.</p>\n<p>Ironically, it was Parscale who seemed to offer the most honest assessment of Facebook’s role in the election (excluding what and when the company knew about Russia). When he explained to <strong>Lesley Stahl,</strong> the interviewer on <em>60 Minutes,</em> that Trump’s campaign had worked with Facebook employees to optimize its ads, Stahl’s mouth made the same gobsmacked look often seen in Disney cartoons. It was the perfect analogous moment for the way many people probably feel about Facebook these days. The half-trillion dollar public company, after all, is first and foremost a machine that turns users into revenue. While Zuckerberg’s personal mission may be to connect the world in a utopian virtual community, Facebook’s prime directive is to maximize the number of people&#8212;Republican or Democrat, Russian or American&#8212;advertising on its platform. If that goal has been complicated in recent months by the Chekhovian melodrama surrounding the Russia investigation, it only underscores the extent to which Zuckerberg’s reach may have exceeded his grasp.</p>\n</section>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":[],"ledeCaption":"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg during a news conference in San Francisco, November 15,

State in Its Cyberwar with Russia","body":"<p>In light of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/russias-highly-sophisticated-facebook-op-raises-new-questions-for-mueller\">revelations</a> that their company’s platform was used by Russian actors during the 2016 election, Facebook executives have <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/what-sheryl-sandberg-didnt-say-about-facebooks-russia-problem\">embarked</a> on an extensive public-relations rehabilitation campaign. Last month, C.E.O. <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> appeared in a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/mark-zuckerberg-backtracks-as-his-russia-problem-spirals\">rare Facebook livestream</a> to discuss steps the company would take to ensure that it wouldn’t be compromised again. Part of that effort, Zuckerberg explained, would require hiring a small army of staff whose explicit job would be to safeguard against the kind of cyber psy-ops that Russia deployed so effectively&#8212;an effort that, as Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-16/facebook-is-said-to-seek-staff-with-national-security-clearance\">reported</a> Monday, appears to be taking shape.</p>\n<p>According to Bloomberg, Facebook is actively seeking employees with national-security clearances. Said hires could include former government contractors or intelligence officials, who are highly sought after for private-sector jobs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Workers with such clearances can access information classified by the U.S. government. Facebook plans to use these people&#8212;and their ability to receive government information about potential threats&#8212;in the company’s attempt to search more proactively for questionable social-media campaigns ahead of elections, according to [a person familiar with the matter], who asked not to be identified because the information is sensitive. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Job candidates with such clearances are often former government and intelligence officials or contractors. The status can carry over to private-sector jobs, as long as the position still requires access to sensitive information. Previously granted clearances become inactive when intelligence workers leave government employment, but they can be reactivated on Facebook’s behalf, the person said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s a logical, if radical, step for a company that has found itself at the center of the Russia melodrama roiling Washington. Facebook has come under intense scrutiny after disclosing early last month that a Kremlin-linked firm bought $100,000 in ads with politically divisive messaging in order to sway the 2016 election. Such actions by foreign agents are of particular interest to special counsel <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> and congressional investigators; Facebook is among a group of tech companies expected to testify before Congress on November 1 regarding Russian use of its platform. Meanwhile, after a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/11/sheryl-sandberg-house-intelligence-hpsci-release-facebook-ads/\">meeting</a> with Facebook C.O.O. <strong>Sheryl Sandberg,</strong> the <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/house-intelligence-committee-says-it-will-release-russian-facebook-ads-2017-10?r=US&amp;IR=T\">House Intelligence Committee</a> said it will release the Facebook ads as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Hiring from a pool of candidates with high-level clearances is likely part of the new, albeit slightly disturbing normal for Facebook; last month, during his live-streamed video, Zuckerberg reassured viewers that the tech giant was “working to ensure the integrity of the German elections” happening days after his broadcast, “from taking actions against thousands of fake accounts, to partnering with public authorities like the Federal Office for Information Security, to sharing security practices with the candidates and parties.” The company’s decision to wade into nation-state territory is a startling reminder of the outsize power it wields . . . and of how few checks and balances are in place to prevent it from abusing that power.</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["facebook","mark zuckerberg","russia","investigation","security clearance"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Mark Zuckerberg’s new strategy begs the question: is Facebook becoming too powerful?","seoTitle":"Facebook Turns to the Deep State in Its Cyberwar with Russia","seoDescription":"Mark Zuckerberg’s new strategy begs the question: is Facebook becoming too powerful?","socialTitle":"Facebook Turns to the Deep State in Its Cyberwar with Russia","socialDescription":"Mark Zuckerberg’s new strategy begs the question: is Facebook becoming too powerful?","issueDate":"","rubric":"Facebook","promoHed":"Facebook Turns to the Deep State in Its Cyberwar with Russia","promoDek":"Mark Zuckerberg’s new strategy begs the question: is Facebook becoming too powerful?","id":"59e4b23b2cf5042e35429e1c","revision":3,"createdAt":"October 16, 2017 9:20 am","modifiedAt":"October 16, 2017 9:46 am","revisionCreatedAt":"October 16, 2017 9:46 am","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","filename":"GettyImages-860273932.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/10/16/59e4b4302abc065328f46dac_GettyImages-860273932.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":640,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":640,"x":400,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":540,"x":450,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":615,"width":1435,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":615,"width":1435,"x":2.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":810,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":810,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1280,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1280,"x":80,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":960,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":960,"x":240,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"Inside The Oculus Connect 4 Event","description":"250: 860273932","caption":"","credit":"By David Paul Morris/Bloomberg.","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"59e4b4302abc065328f46dad","revision":1,"createdAt":"October 16, 2017 9:29 am","modifiedAt":"October 16, 2017 9:29 am","revisionCreatedAt":"October 16, 2017 9:29 am","tags":[],"altText":"Inside The Oculus Connect 4 Event","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Zac Frank","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

That’s a pretty big number, especially when you consider that it’s the number of people who are currently employed by Facebook. Those 20,000 employees include insanely smart people with degrees from Stanford, Harvard, and M.I.T., many of whom spend their days toiling away on various revenue products, particularly in advertising-technology features&#8212;or ad tech, as it’s known in the industry&#8212;that helped the company generate some $27.6 billion in total revenue last year. So why is it that none of those employees noticed that Russian operatives were using Facebook to manipulate the U.S. electoral process? And why is it&#8212;months after <strong>Donald Trump</strong> was sworn in as president, and after deadly protests in Charlottesville&#8212;that  those workers allowed organizations to buy ads on the platform <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/facebook-let-its-advertisers-target-jew-haters\">targeting</a> people who searched for phrases such as “Jew haters”?</p>\n<p>This ad-targeting mess has quickly become the Exxon Valdez of the Internet. Google, for its part, has 72,053 employees, many of whom are also working on smart algorithms to improve the company’s ad revenue, which accounts for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reza_zadeh/status/908252417182986240?refsrc=email&amp;s=11\">88 percent of its income</a>. And yet, on Friday, BuzzFeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/google-allowed-advertisers-to-target-jewish-parasite-black?utm_term=.tnvl22kGZ#.hkmkEErmx\">reported that Google</a> allows groups to target ads toward people searching for racist phrases. So when people type in search queries like “Jewish parasite,” “black people ruin everything,” or “the evil Jew,” ads can potentially be served next to those keywords, and Google makes money off the transaction. The Daily Beast, meanwhile, also reported that Twitter <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/twitter-lets-you-target-millions-of-users-who-may-like-the-n-word\">allows people to target users</a> on the platform who use the n-word and other putrid, disgusting, racist terms.</p>\n<h4>Video: Why Is Lying the New Normal In the Trump Era?</h4>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/59020600fd2e6176d6000008.js?muted=1\"></div></div><p>Since the election (and <a href=\"https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/friends-and-influence-for-sale-online/?_r=0\">even leading up to it</a>), it’s become abundantly clear that social media presented itself as a profoundly useful tool for the Russians, extremists, and possibly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/jared-kushner-data-operation-russia-facebook\">even people within the Trump campaign</a>, to potentially disfigure our electoral process. Before Trump co-opted the term “fake news” to describe entirely accurate, if unfavorable, stories about him, <em>real</em> fake news was being created and proliferated at scale. Algorithms on Facebook didn’t work to try to stop this from happening, but rather to ensure that these fake stories landed right on the digital doorsteps of the people who might find them most interesting, and who might change their votes as a result of that content. Twitter’s problem with political bots has existed for as long as I can remember. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/900158639884955648\">a data researcher noticed</a> that there were hundreds of Twitter accounts ending with a string of eight numbers (like @DavidJo52951945) that only tweeted about hot-button political topics, all of which followed each other. This might seem harmless on some level, but these accounts had been disseminating incredibly divisive (and oftentimes fake) stories about Brexit, Ukraine, and Syria, plus anti-immigration articles from outlets like Breitbart and excessively schismatic articles from the <em>Daily Mail.</em> The researcher also found that these accounts only tweeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/900159680806309888\">between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Moscow time</a>, and only during the week&#8212;almost as if it were someone’s job in Russia to do so. The accounts have tens of thousands of followers, and the suspected  propagandists behind them <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarryGsGhost/status/895840586661593088\">stoked the flames of dissent</a> by creating far-left\nbots which would go after Trump and his supporters.</p>\n<p>I don’t actually see these issues as massive problems within themselves. Of course people are going to try to manipulate these technologies. The larger issue, however, is that these enormous, profoundly wealthy companies aren’t doing enough to stop them, and are not being held accountable. (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/19/twitter-troll-crackdown-is-working.html\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/14/media/facebook-fake-news-france-election/index.html\">Facebook</a> have attempted to crackdown on trolls in some ways since the election.) Curiously, Wall Street, which still remains oddly buoyant in the Trump era (it’s amazing what the rich will sacrifice for tax reform) is not chastising Silicon Valley for the extensive role it played in the mess we find ourselves in today. Facebook is worth $491 billion, despite months’ worth of news stories indicating it allowed Russian accounts to buy and target pages and ads <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/09/information-operations-update/\">on its network during the election</a>, which estimates say could have reached 70 million Americans. Twitter’s stock, while bumpy, has barely moved since news definitively broke about all of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/us/politics/russia-facebook-twitter-election.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur\">“fake Americans”</a> that Russia created and operated on the social network during the election. (Here’s a fun game: go look at Donald Trump’s latest followers on Twitter and see how long it takes you to find a real human being who has recently joined and followed him. Most accounts have names like @N4wapWLVHmeYKAq and @Aiana37481266.)</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, <strong>Sam Biddle</strong> <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/09/11/make-mark-zuckerberg-testify/\">argued on The Intercept</a> that <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> should be forced to go before Congress about the role Facebook played in Russia’s propaganda efforts. “Zuckerberg should publicly testify under oath before Congress on his company’s capabilities to influence the political process, be it Russian meddling or anything else,” Biddle wrote. “If the company is as powerful as it promises advertisers, it should be held accountable.” There are also reports that there is now a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-13/mueller-probe-is-said-to-have-red-hot-focus-on-social-media\">“red-hot”</a> focus on social media by special counsel <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> investigation into the 2016 election. But in both of these instances, there needs to be real consequences. It doesn’t take 20,000 employees to see the apathy and neglect these platforms have played, and continue to play, in the attacks against democracy by the people who want to see it fall.</p>\n<p>Back in 2011, an early Facebook employee, who later left the company, said, “The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.” He then added, aptly: “That sucks.” But after Brexit, the election of Trump, the rise of white supremacists, and the pummeling of the media, it seems the updated version of that adage is that the best minds of our generation are not thinking about how their ad technology can be used for nefarious purposes. And that really sucks.</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["silicon valley","russia","mark zuckerberg","jack dorsey","donald trump","brexit","facebook","twitter"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"magazine","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Silicon Valley deserves enormous blame for the role it played in the election of Trump and Brexit, and tolerating racism on its platforms.

it also wants to be loved. Social media may have divided us, but <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> is finding new ways to connect the world. Hate speech may have blossomed on Twitter, but <strong>Jack Dorsey</strong> is working to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16505954/twitter-harassment-abuse-calendar-schedule-fixes-updates\">find a solution</a>. Automation and artificial intelligence may be displacing jobs, but Bay Area futurists are experimenting with a universal basic income. Even as it has grown into a multi-trillion-dollar industry with a fearsome lobbying wing in Washington, Silicon Valley wants to be remembered for the counterculture that Google engineers long ago priced out of San Francisco.</p>\n<p>That legacy of dreamy utopianism continues to inform the tech industry’s self-perception, even as its financial imperatives collide with its politics. On Thursday night, Reuters <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-dreamers/exclusive-tech-companies-to-lobby-for-immigrant-dreamers-to-remain-in-u-s-idUSKBN1CP03Z\">reported</a> that Facebook and Google were among nearly two dozen companies planning to launch a group to lobby for bipartisan legislation to protect  DACA recipients, better known as Dreamers. The group, called the Coalition for the American Dream, will try to enlist other companies in urging Congress to pass legislation codifying the Obama-era program, which <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has said he will rescind. If he does, nearly 800,000 Dreamers will be at risk of deportation.</p>\n<p>Facebook C.E.O. <strong>Mark Zuckerberg,</strong> who helped found a pro-immigration reform group in 2013, has been particularly vocal in pushing back against the Trump administration’s more restrictive policies. But Facebook&#39;s idealistic self-perception seems to be at odds with its advertising goals. As Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-18/facebook-and-google-helped-anti-refugee-campaign-in-swing-states\">reported</a> this week, both Facebook and Google worked diligently to maximize the reach of Islamophobic video ads for an anti-refugee nonprofit called Secure America Now. The nonprofit reportedly spent “millions” in ad dollars to ensure that its videos&#8212;including one that portrayed “colorful scenes of Main Street America” along with “black-and-white pictures of Muslims who have carried out attacks in the U.S.,” and another that imagined France and Germany governed by Sharia law&#8212;had maximum impact on both platforms. (Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.)</p>\n<p>As a public company, Facebook has an obligation to maximize its profits for shareholders. That may mean courting the business of anti-immigration groups that want to advertise on its platform. As Trump’s former digital campaign director revealed last week, Facebook was more than happy to work closely with the Trump campaign to optimize the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-campaigns-embrace-of-facebook-shows-companys-growing-reach-in-elections/2017/10/08/e5e5f156-a93b-11e7-b3aa-c0e2e1d41e38_story.html?utm_term=.904bb16b9f51\">nearly $70 million</a> in ads it had purchased. But those objectives increasingly come into conflict with the progressive face that Zuckerberg has shown the public. As Facebook comes under increased scrutiny from congressional lawmakers as part of their inquiries into Russian election interference, those contradictions become more evident.</p>\n<p>Immigration reform is the rare issue that is both good politics and good business for a company like Facebook, where more than <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/02/06/donald-trump-visas-facebook/\">15 percent</a> of employees used a temporary work visa in 2016. As Facebook struggles to reconcile its nominally liberal worldview with its financial reality, Zuckerberg’s vociferous defense of the H-1B visa program and DACA seems to offer one solution to Facebook’s identity crisis. It also highlights how empty that rhetoric risks becoming.</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["facebook","mark zuckerberg","google","silicon valley","donald trump","DACA","immigration"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Facebook and Google are among a group of tech companies pushing to preserve DACA.

For the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together, I ask forgiveness and I will work to do better.” It was a completely different tone than Zuckerberg had taken as recently as 11 months ago, when he dismissed allegations that the prevalence of misinformation on Facebook had been used to sway the 2016 presidential election, calling them a “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/10/13594558/mark-zuckerberg-election-fake-news-trump\">pretty crazy idea</a>,” and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/zuckerberg-brushed-off-obamas-private-warnings-about-facebook\">brushed off</a> <strong>Barack Obama’s</strong> privately voiced concerns.

On its “safety check” page, which lets users in the vicinity of a natural disaster or safety incident check in to let their friends and family know they’re O.K., Facebook prominently <a href=\"https://qz.com/1092194/las-vegas-shooting-the-scariest-part-of-facebooks-safety-check-in-a-mass-shooting-fb/\">displayed four news stories</a>, including one from a self-proclaimed far-right Web site, which baselessly suggested that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cwarzel/status/914878000486928387\">the shooting</a> was “more like the kind of target a Left-wing nutjob would choose than a Right-wing nutjob.” Thanks to Facebook’s algorithm, a report from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robpegoraro/status/914832290362150914\">Gateway Pundit</a> made its way onto the site’s crisis-response page ahead of legitimate news sources like NBC.
