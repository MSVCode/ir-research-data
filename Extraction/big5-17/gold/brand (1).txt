The Luxury Ecommerce Experience: What Can Small Businesses Learn From Brands Like Burberry And Gucci

E-commerce has long been a sore point for many luxury brands. Luxury brands differentiate themselves in part by the high-end experiences they offer in-store and have sometimes struggled to adapt those experiences to the web. Online, without the immersive experience of walking into a luxury storefront and being greeted by a thoughtfully curated assortment of products and a knowledgeable salesperson, high-end retailers worry whether their luxury goods will be as appealing.

Luxury retailers seek to solve this problem by re-creating luxury experiences online. Here are a few ways they’re achieving that purpose in the ecommerce realm:

Storytelling

Storytelling is arguably the most important aspect of the luxury e-commerce experience. Luxury brands are defined by their heritage, by a rich history of craftsmanship and design, and those aspects of the brand must be communicated online.

Storytelling is a critical component for the success of nearly any lifestyle brand. But for luxury brands in particular, storytelling around heritage is a way for them to distinguish themselves from lesser competitors. Luxury brands focus on storytelling content as a means of differentiating and communicating their value. In the online world, without all the benefits of the in-store experience, customers need a reason to commit to expensive purchases. Storytelling is all about luxury brands telling customers what makes their products special and why they’re worthy of their customers’ attention.

Burberry does a lot of storytelling around their fashion heritage and expertise. They have an entire micro-site dedicated to video and content surrounding their fashion week shows. This content demonstrates to the user that Burberry is on the cutting edge of fashion.
