North Korea threatens to go nuclear over US military exercises

North Korea threatened the United States with an “unimaginable” nuclear strike for conducting military exercises with South Korea in the waters off the Korean peninsula, according to a report Thursday.

“The U.S. is running amok by introducing under our nose the targets we have set as primary ones,” the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency warned, Newsweek reported. “The U.S. should expect that it would face an unimaginable strike at an unimaginable time.”

The regime also blamed the US for “creating tension on the eve of war” by taking part in civilian evacuation drills in South Korea.

US and South Korean military forces began five days of military exercises Monday that involve fighter jets, helicopters and about 40 ships and submarines.

North Korean President Kim Jong Un’s government considers the drills a rehearsal for an invasion of his country.

Tensions have increased between Pyongyang and Washington since the regime began testing intercontinental ballistic missiles that could hit the US mainland. It also detonated a nuclear device.

The United Nations imposed strict economic sanctions against the country in retaliation for continuing its weapons development program.

President Trump has said he would “totally destroy” North Korea in defense of the US or its allies.

Kim has threatened to strike the US territory of Guam in the Pacific.
