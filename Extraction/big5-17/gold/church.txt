Tourist killed in famous church by falling chunk of ceiling

A tourist died visiting the famous Basilica of the Holy Cross in Florence, Italy, when a piece of the ceiling hit him, authorities said.

The falling stone dropped from a height of about 60 feet before striking a 52-year-old man at the popular tourist site, ABC News reported.

The stone had reportedly been supporting a beam near a chapel on the right side of the church.

The victim was on vacation from Barcelona, Spain, and touring the church with his wife when the incident occurred, according to ABC News.

The church was temporarily closed while authorities tried to revive the man, who died at the scene.

“Deeply sorry for the incident at the Basilica of the Holy Cross where a Spanish tourist was killed,” Florence Mayor Dario Nardella tweeted in Italian. “Engineers from the ministry are already on site.”

The Basilica of the Holy Cross is the final resting place of Michelangelo, Niccolo Machiavelli and Galileo Galilei.
