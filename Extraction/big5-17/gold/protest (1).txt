Paris: Violent protests after French police kill Chinese man

Violent clashes in Paris over the police killing of a Chinese man have left three police officers injured and several people detained.

Demonstrators had gathered outside a police station on Monday to pay homage to the slain man.

His family denies police reports he attacked an officer with a sharp object as they responded to reports of a domestic dispute at his home.

China has formally complained, calling on France to protect its nationals.

The 56-year-old man - father of-five Liu Shaoyo - was shot dead on Sunday night in Paris's 19th arrondissement (district).

Police say he attacked an officer with a sharp object as soon as he came to the door and the officer was only saved by his bullet-proof vest.

But the family lawyer says it "totally disputes" this account. 

One of the man's daughters told French media he had gone to the door holding a pair of scissors he had been using to prepare fish.

"They smashed the door in, the shot went off and my father ended up on the floor," she told the Parisian newspaper.

China's foreign affairs ministry has lodged an official protest, urging French authorities to do all they can to shed light on the incident and to protect its nationals' "security and rights".

The police watchdog is due to interview the family later on Tuesday.

Up to 35 people were reportedly detained at Monday's protest, in which at least 150 people took part, some shouting "Murderers!"

There were accusations of police brutality last month, after young black man said police had sodomised him with a truncheon.
