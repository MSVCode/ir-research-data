(Photo Credit:MANJUNATH KIRAN/AFP/Getty Images)[/caption]\r\n\r\nEven as the country prepares to ban liquor sales near major highways to curb drunk driving this year, consumption of alcohol in India has expanded at an average of 8.9% annually in the past six years, reaching an estimated <a href=\"http://www.nabca.org/assets/docs/DNU_FEB28.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">$22 billion</a> (1.46 trillion rupees) last year. India is the 3rd largest liquor market in the world, with an overall retail market size of<a href=\"http://www.indigoedge.com/insight-case-study.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> $35 billion</a> per annum. A global study by Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has found that alcohol consumption in India has risen by <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/alcohol-consumption-rising-fast-in-india-oecd-report/\" target=\"_blank\">55%</a> over a period of 20 years, from 1992 to 2012.\r\n\r\nWith the minimum drinking age varying from 18 to 25 across states, India had approximately 485 million people of legal drinking age in 2013. This is more than the population of the United States and Mexico combined. Another <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-22/indian-battle-with-booze-isn-t-stopping-johnnie-walker-s-maker\" target=\"_blank\">150 million</a> are predicted to join this group by 2018. &ldquo;The underlying consumption potential in India isn&rsquo;t strong, it&rsquo;s extremely strong,&rdquo; Pernod Ricard Chief Executive Officer <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-22/indian-battle-with-booze-isn-t-stopping-johnnie-walker-s-maker\" target=\"_blank\">Alexandre Ricard</a> told reporters in London in February this year. The world&rsquo;s second-largest distiller sells Royal Stag and Imperial Blue whiskeys in India.\r\n\r\nNot to be left behind by the larger counterparts and established names, in order to target young consumers of drinks, varied startups have emerged to target this ripe market. These include microbreweries, apps that offer lucrative savings on alcohol and the needs of the after-party demographic.\r\n\r\n<strong>Emergence of domestic beer brands&nbsp;</strong>\r\n\r\nWhile beer sales volumes are forecasted to grow higher at an average <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/liquor/beer-on-a-high-to-pip-hard-drinks-this-year/articleshow/54725677.cms\" target=\"_blank\">5.7% </a>between 2015 and 2020, the growth in spirits as a category will be less than 2%. According to market research firm <a href=\"http://www.euromonitor.com/alcoholic-drinks-in-india/report\" target=\"_blank\">Euromonitor International</a> an expanding middle class, growth in social drinking and a shift away from hard liquor due to heath concerns are the main drivers of growth in beer consumption. As beer continues to be viewed as an entry level drink compared to spirits, craft beer is expected to see a surge in sales across major cities in India. Meanwhile, prohibition is likely to impact beer less than spirits, with most states focusing restrictive measures on stronger alcoholic drinks.\r\n\r\nDue to these strong fundamentals in the beer market, Ishaan Puri launched India&rsquo;s first home brewed craft beer in October 2016;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://whiterhinobrewing.in/\" target=\"_blank\">White Rhino</a> was an instant success. Beer lovers liked it, and word of mouth was instrumental in pushing up its demand.\r\n\r\nThis was a pattern similar to craft beer <a href=\"http://www.bira91.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bira 91</a> that was launched in February 2015. Bira 91 is the brainchild of first generation New Delhi-based entrepreneur Ankur Jain. Unhappy with the standard of breweries in India, Jain decided to lease a brewery in the Flanders region of Belgium, and import his brew into India. Bira 91 is available in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune, Goa and Kolkata, and was launched in New York this summer, where Jain has set up an office with a small team.\r\n\r\nUnlike Ankur Jain, Ishaan Puri kept White Rhino&rsquo;s distribution restricted to Gurugam before he entered parts of New Delhi at the end of December 2016. Since then, in the last four months, the average sales of White Rhino have touched half a million liters a year. In his interview <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/those-who-buy-a-pint-of-beer-for-rs-100-should-upgrade-to-white-rhino-says-founder-ishaan-puri/articleshow/56183703.cms\" target=\"_blank\">Ishaan Puri</a>&nbsp;told the Economic Times that he planned to focus on Delhi and Gurugram at present, but had plans for future expansion. &ldquo;We may look at entering one more market (Karnataka or Maharashtra) in the summer.&rdquo; At present, White Rhino is available in two variants, a Belgian style wheat beer and a Munich style lager priced for more than $2 (<a href=\"http://www.dfordelhi.in/white-rhino-brewing-company/\" target=\"_blank\">Rs 160</a>) in New Delhi and Rs 150 in Gurugram.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n<strong>Purchasing alcohol on smartphone</strong>\r\n\r\nFounded in 2013 by Aneesh Bhasin and Shiladitya Mukhopadhyaya, <a href=\"http://hipcask.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hipcask</a> has partnered with several of Mumbai's leading craft brew pubs and restaurants. Via its beer passport, a virtual product created and offered by Hipcask, consumers buy into what's described as a \"pre-paid beer plan\". They avail certain special offer prices at any of Hipcask's partner restaurants and bars that stock the particular brand of beer. Before pivoting to its current avatar in 2015, it had started out as a content discovery app with a database of wines, beers and whisky. This year Hipcask also has plans to offer passports for whisky and wine.\r\n\r\nAs a recent addition to this space, the recently launched <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/hipbar/id1179371753?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">HipBar app</a> is a mobile wallet catering to&nbsp;a network of drinking establishments where users get a discounted rate, avoiding the premium most other customers pay on individual servings of alcohol. It allows customers to buy full bottles of their favorite booze online, and then redeem it in any restaurant or hotel across the country. For example, if a user buys a bottle of expensive whisky for $76 (Rs 5,000), they&nbsp;can visit a hotel or bar and use the app to collect a serving of that alcohol. The hotel or bar&nbsp;will then charge the patron for the portion, which will be paid through the app. The app will immediately reflect a reduction in the volume of the prepaid bottle. The bottle of whisky that was purchased will stand as a prepaid instrument and its value will diminish as the customer&nbsp;continues to drink from the bottle.\r\n\r\n<strong>Post party hangover</strong>\r\n\r\nOla, Uber, app-based <a href=\"https://www.driveu.in/\" target=\"_blank\">DriveU</a>&nbsp;and Party Hard Drivers (<a href=\"http://www.partyharddrivers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PHD</a>) are entities providing after-party pick up and drop off services to frequent party-goers. And for customers who prefer to party at home, in the past few years a number of late night delivery startups have emerged. Midnight Xprs, Fly By Knight, Mad Bites, Cravebusters, Batman Delivers, and Nite Out supply items such as&nbsp;food, condoms or cigarettes - items catering to customers&rsquo; late night demands.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most significant yet underserved segment of the alcohol consumers market is the after-party economy of hangovers. Along with Himalaya's Liv52 derivative PartySmart pill, in India the newest product that promises to make hangovers at least bearable is a brand called Morning Fresh.\r\n\r\nLaunched in November 2015, Morning Fresh&rsquo;s natural ingredients include&nbsp;silk protein hydrolysate, Vitamin C and Mulberry Extract. At less than $2 (<a href=\"http://www.drinkmorningfresh.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rs 125</a>) a bottle it is a smartly packaged, compact, flavored drink (cola, mint and strawberry), which is meant to be taken as the last shot of the night. Initially starting off with roughly 200 &ndash; 300 bottles a month, last year Morning Fresh clocked up sales of around 3000 bottles per month. It currently retails through prominent pubs, restaurants, e-commerce on websites and other portals like Amazon which caters to its Pan-India demand.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</p>","description":"India is the third largest liquor market in the world.

(Photo Credit:MANJUNATH KIRAN/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n</div>\n<p>Even as the country prepares to ban liquor sales near major highways to curb drunk driving this year, consumption of alcohol in India has expanded at an average of 8.9% annually in the past six years, reaching an estimated <a href=\"http://www.nabca.org/assets/docs/DNU_FEB28.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">$22 billion</a> (1.46 trillion rupees) last year. India is the 3rd largest liquor market in the world, with an overall retail market size of<a href=\"http://www.indigoedge.com/insight-case-study.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> $35 billion</a> per annum. A global study by Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has found that alcohol consumption in India has risen by <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/alcohol-consumption-rising-fast-in-india-oecd-report/\" target=\"_blank\">55%</a> over a period of 20 years, from 1992 to 2012.</p>\n<p>With the minimum drinking age varying from 18 to 25 across states, India had approximately 485 million people of legal drinking age in 2013. This is more than the population of the United States and Mexico combined. Another <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-22/indian-battle-with-booze-isn-t-stopping-johnnie-walker-s-maker\" target=\"_blank\">150 million</a> are predicted to join this group by 2018. “The underlying consumption potential in India isn’t strong, it’s extremely strong,” Pernod Ricard Chief Executive Officer <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-22/indian-battle-with-booze-isn-t-stopping-johnnie-walker-s-maker\" target=\"_blank\">Alexandre Ricard</a> told reporters in London in February this year. The world’s second-largest distiller sells Royal Stag and Imperial Blue whiskeys in India.</p>\n<p>Not to be left behind by the larger counterparts and established names, in order to target young consumers of drinks, varied startups have emerged to target this ripe market. These include microbreweries, apps that offer lucrative savings on alcohol and the needs of the after-party demographic.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><strong>Emergence of domestic beer brands&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>While beer sales volumes are forecasted to grow higher at an average <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/liquor/beer-on-a-high-to-pip-hard-drinks-this-year/articleshow/54725677.cms\" target=\"_blank\">5.7% </a>between 2015 and 2020, the growth in spirits as a category will be less than 2%. According to market research firm <a href=\"http://www.euromonitor.com/alcoholic-drinks-in-india/report\" target=\"_blank\">Euromonitor International</a> an expanding middle class, growth in social drinking and a shift away from hard liquor due to heath concerns are the main drivers of growth in beer consumption. As beer continues to be viewed as an entry level drink compared to spirits, craft beer is expected to see a surge in sales across major cities in India. Meanwhile, prohibition is likely to impact beer less than spirits, with most states focusing restrictive measures on stronger alcoholic drinks.</p>\n<p>Due to these strong fundamentals in the beer market, Ishaan Puri launched India’s first home brewed craft beer in October 2016;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://whiterhinobrewing.in/\" target=\"_blank\">White Rhino</a> was an instant success. Beer lovers liked it, and word of mouth was instrumental in pushing up its demand.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>This was a pattern similar to craft beer <a href=\"http://www.bira91.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bira 91</a> that was launched in February 2015. Bira 91 is the brainchild of first generation New Delhi-based entrepreneur Ankur Jain. Unhappy with the standard of breweries in India, Jain decided to lease a brewery in the Flanders region of Belgium, and import his brew into India. Bira 91 is available in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune, Goa and Kolkata, and was launched in New York this summer, where Jain has set up an office with a small team.</p>\n<p>Unlike Ankur Jain, Ishaan Puri kept White Rhino’s distribution restricted to Gurugam before he entered parts of New Delhi at the end of December 2016. Since then, in the last four months, the average sales of White Rhino have touched half a million liters a year. In his interview <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/those-who-buy-a-pint-of-beer-for-rs-100-should-upgrade-to-white-rhino-says-founder-ishaan-puri/articleshow/56183703.cms\" target=\"_blank\">Ishaan Puri</a>&nbsp;told the Economic Times that he planned to focus on Delhi and Gurugram at present, but had plans for future expansion. “We may look at entering one more market (Karnataka or Maharashtra) in the summer.” At present, White Rhino is available in two variants, a Belgian style wheat beer and a Munich style lager priced for more than $2 (<a href=\"http://www.dfordelhi.in/white-rhino-brewing-company/\" target=\"_blank\">Rs 160</a>) in New Delhi and Rs 150 in Gurugram.</p>","<p><strong>Purchasing alcohol on smartphone</strong></p>\n<p>Founded in 2013 by Aneesh Bhasin and Shiladitya Mukhopadhyaya, <a href=\"http://hipcask.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hipcask</a> has partnered with several of Mumbai's leading craft brew pubs and restaurants. Via its beer passport, a virtual product created and offered by Hipcask, consumers buy into what's described as a &quot;pre-paid beer plan&quot;. They avail certain special offer prices at any of Hipcask's partner restaurants and bars that stock the particular brand of beer. Before pivoting to its current avatar in 2015, it had started out as a content discovery app with a database of wines, beers and whisky. This year Hipcask also has plans to offer passports for whisky and wine.</p>\n<p>As a recent addition to this space, the recently launched <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/hipbar/id1179371753?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">HipBar app</a> is a mobile wallet catering to&nbsp;a network of drinking establishments where users get a discounted rate, avoiding the premium most other customers pay on individual servings of alcohol. It allows customers to buy full bottles of their favorite booze online, and then redeem it in any restaurant or hotel across the country. For example, if a user buys a bottle of expensive whisky for $76 (Rs 5,000), they&nbsp;can visit a hotel or bar and use the app to collect a serving of that alcohol. The hotel or bar&nbsp;will then charge the patron for the portion, which will be paid through the app. The app will immediately reflect a reduction in the volume of the prepaid bottle. The bottle of whisky that was purchased will stand as a prepaid instrument and its value will diminish as the customer&nbsp;continues to drink from the bottle.</p>\n<p><strong>Post party hangover</strong></p>\n<p>Ola, Uber, app-based <a href=\"https://www.driveu.in/\" target=\"_blank\">DriveU</a>&nbsp;and Party Hard Drivers (<a href=\"http://www.partyharddrivers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PHD</a>) are entities providing after-party pick up and drop off services to frequent party-goers. And for customers who prefer to party at home, in the past few years a number of late night delivery startups have emerged. Midnight Xprs, Fly By Knight, Mad Bites, Cravebusters, Batman Delivers, and Nite Out supply items such as&nbsp;food, condoms or cigarettes - items catering to customers’ late night demands.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>Perhaps the most significant yet underserved segment of the alcohol consumers market is the after-party economy of hangovers. Along with Himalaya's Liv52 derivative PartySmart pill, in India the newest product that promises to make hangovers at least bearable is a brand called Morning Fresh.</p>\n<p>Launched in November 2015, Morning Fresh’s natural ingredients include&nbsp;silk protein hydrolysate, Vitamin C and Mulberry Extract. At less than $2 (<a href=\"http://www.drinkmorningfresh.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rs 125</a>) a bottle it is a smartly packaged, compact, flavored drink (cola, mint and strawberry), which is meant to be taken as the last shot of the night. Initially starting off with roughly 200 – 300 bottles a month, last year Morning Fresh clocked up sales of around 3000 bottles per month. It currently retails through prominent pubs, restaurants, e-commerce on websites and other portals like Amazon which caters to its Pan-India demand.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"doNotPaginate":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business","displayName":"Business"},{"id":"channel_13","channelName":"Asia","url":"/asia","displayName":"Asia"},{"id":"channel_3","channelName":"Tech","url":"/technology","displayName":"Tech"},{"id":"channel_3section_22","channelName":"Tech","sectionName":"Mobile","url":"/mobile","displayName":"Mobile"},{"id":"channel_4","channelName":"Entrepreneurs","url":"/entrepreneurs","displayName":"Entrepreneurs"},{"id":"channel_4section_124","channelName":"Entrepreneurs","sectionName":"Startups","url":"/startups","displayName":"Startups"}],"pTagCount":17,"hashtags":["BigBusiness"],"editorsPick":false,"numberOfImages":1,"relativeVideos":[{"videoId":"5256948285001","title":"FedEx Plows Into Holiday Season With Icy Earnings Results","playerId":"S1EBSbDn","keyValues":"displaysection=&fl=&channel=business,asia,tech,entrepreneurs&swimlane=&specialslot=&section=tech:mobile,entrepreneurs:startups&id=blogAndPostId/blog/post/4594-520&brand=&displaychannel=asia","autoPlay":true},{"videoId":"5248383872001","title":"Apple Could Sink $1B Into Softbank's Mega Tech Fund","playerId":"S1EBSbDn","keyValues":"displaysection=&fl=&channel=business,asia,tech,entrepreneurs&swimlane=&specialslot=&section=tech:mobile,entrepreneurs:startups&id=blogAndPostId/blog/post/4594-520&brand=&displaychannel=asia","autoPlay":true},{"videoId":"5246108596001","title":"American Express Ups Paid Parental Leave To 5 Months; Boosts IVF, Surrogacy Benefits","playerId":"S1EBSbDn","keyValues":"displaysection=&fl=&channel=business,asia,tech,entrepreneurs&swimlane=&specialslot=&section=tech:mobile,entrepreneurs:startups&id=blogAndPostId/blog/post/4594-520&brand=&displaychannel=asia","autoPlay":true},{"videoId":"5254186193001","title":"Will Trump Hurt Tesla's Prospects In China?","playerId":"S1EBSbDn","keyValues":"displaysection=&fl=&channel=business,asia,tech,entrepreneurs&swimlane=&specialslot=&section=tech:mobile,entrepreneurs:startups&id=blogAndPostId/blog/post/4594-520&brand=&displaychannel=asia","autoPlay":true},{"videoId":"5251171296001","title":"Sumner Redstone Will Exit Viacom's Board, But That Won't Change Much","playerId":"S1EBSbDn","keyValues":"displaysection=&fl=&channel=business,asia,tech,entrepreneurs&swimlane=&specialslot=&section=tech:mobile,entrepreneurs:startups&id=blogAndPostId/blog/post/4594-520&brand=&displaychannel=asia","autoPlay":true},{"videoId":"5229833626001","title":"Inside The Issue: The Just 100","playerId":"S1EBSbDn","keyValues":"displaysection=&fl=&channel=business,asia,tech,entrepreneurs&swimlane=&specialslot=&section=tech:mobile,entrepreneurs:startups&id=blogAndPostId/blog/post/4594-520&brand=&displaychannel=asia","autoPlay":true},{"videoId":"5259970888001","title":"The Biggest Asian Investments In The U.S. In 2016","playerId":"S1EBSbDn","keyValues":"displaysection=&fl=&channel=business,asia,tech,entrepreneurs&swimlane=&specialslot=&section=tech:mobile,entrepreneurs:startups&id=blogAndPostId/blog/post/4594-520&brand=&displaychannel=asia","autoPlay":true},{"videoId":"5244777428001","title":"Plans For CBS And Viacom Merger Called Off After Redstones Pull Support","playerId":"S1EBSbDn","keyValues":"displaysection=&fl=&channel=business,asia,tech,entrepreneurs&swimlane=&specialslot=&section=tech:mobile,entrepreneurs:startups&id=blogAndPostId/blog/post/4594-520&brand=&displaychannel=asia","autoPlay":true}],"sentimentCompanies":[],"trumpContent":false,"digestDisabled":false,"brandVoiceTitle":"How Startups Are Catering To India's $35B Liquour Market, The 3rd Largest In The World","allIndividualAuthors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/2384179","name":"Karan Kashyap","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fc897ece4b5c591c615d4eeab6776dd5?s=40&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":62,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fc897ece4b5c591c615d4eeab6776dd5?s=62&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":136,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fc897ece4b5c591c615d4eeab6776dd5?s=136&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":400,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fc897ece4b5c591c615d4eeab6776dd5?s=400&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/krnkashyap/","primaryChannel":{"id":"channel_13","channelId":"channel_13","channelName":"Asia","url":"/asia","shortName":"Asia","displayName":"Asia"},"type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/krnkashyap/","twitterName":"krn_kashyap","authorType":"individual","email":"krnkashyap@gmail.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I cover startup ecosystems and policy in South Asia.","timestamp":1471927481824,"description":"I am a founder, who has established two enterprises.

<p>Even as the country prepares to ban liquor sales near major highways to curb drunk driving this year, consumption of alcohol in India has expanded at an average of 8.9% annually in the past six years, reaching an estimated <a href="http://www.nabca.org/assets/docs/DNU_FEB28.pdf" target="_blank">$22 billion</a> (1.46 trillion rupees) last year. India is the 3rd largest liquor market in the world, with an overall retail market size of<a href="http://www.indigoedge.com/insight-case-study.pdf" target="_blank"> $35 billion</a> per annum. A global study by Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has found that alcohol consumption in India has risen by <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/alcohol-consumption-rising-fast-in-india-oecd-report/" target="_blank">55%</a> over a period of 20 years, from 1992 to 2012.</p>
<p>With the minimum drinking age varying from 18 to 25 across states, India had approximately 485 million people of legal drinking age in 2013. This is more than the population of the United States and Mexico combined. Another <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-22/indian-battle-with-booze-isn-t-stopping-johnnie-walker-s-maker" target="_blank">150 million</a> are predicted to join this group by 2018. “The underlying consumption potential in India isn’t strong, it’s extremely strong,” Pernod Ricard Chief Executive Officer <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-22/indian-battle-with-booze-isn-t-stopping-johnnie-walker-s-maker" target="_blank">Alexandre Ricard</a> told reporters in London in February this year. The world’s second-largest distiller sells Royal Stag and Imperial Blue whiskeys in India.</p>
<p>Not to be left behind by the larger counterparts and established names, in order to target young consumers of drinks, varied startups have emerged to target this ripe market. These include microbreweries, apps that offer lucrative savings on alcohol and the needs of the after-party demographic.</p>
<div id="inread" article-ad-inbody="inread" class="inread"></div>
<p><strong>Emergence of domestic beer brands&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>While beer sales volumes are forecasted to grow higher at an average <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/liquor/beer-on-a-high-to-pip-hard-drinks-this-year/articleshow/54725677.cms" target="_blank">5.7% </a>between 2015 and 2020, the growth in spirits as a category will be less than 2%. According to market research firm <a href="http://www.euromonitor.com/alcoholic-drinks-in-india/report" target="_blank">Euromonitor International</a> an expanding middle class, growth in social drinking and a shift away from hard liquor due to heath concerns are the main drivers of growth in beer consumption. As beer continues to be viewed as an entry level drink compared to spirits, craft beer is expected to see a surge in sales across major cities in India. Meanwhile, prohibition is likely to impact beer less than spirits, with most states focusing restrictive measures on stronger alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>Due to these strong fundamentals in the beer market, Ishaan Puri launched India’s first home brewed craft beer in October 2016;&nbsp;<a href="http://whiterhinobrewing.in/" target="_blank">White Rhino</a> was an instant success. Beer lovers liked it, and word of mouth was instrumental in pushing up its demand.</p>
<div class="vestpocket" vest-pocket=""></div>
<p>This was a pattern similar to craft beer <a href="http://www.bira91.com/" target="_blank">Bira 91</a> that was launched in February 2015. Bira 91 is the brainchild of first generation New Delhi-based entrepreneur Ankur Jain. Unhappy with the standard of breweries in India, Jain decided to lease a brewery in the Flanders region of Belgium, and import his brew into India. Bira 91 is available in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune, Goa and Kolkata, and was launched in New York this summer, where Jain has set up an office with a small team.</p>
<p>Unlike Ankur Jain, Ishaan Puri kept White Rhino’s distribution restricted to Gurugam before he entered parts of New Delhi at the end of December 2016. Since then, in the last four months, the average sales of White Rhino have touched half a million liters a year. In his interview <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/those-who-buy-a-pint-of-beer-for-rs-100-should-upgrade-to-white-rhino-says-founder-ishaan-puri/articleshow/56183703.cms" target="_blank">Ishaan Puri</a>&nbsp;told the Economic Times that he planned to focus on Delhi and Gurugram at present, but had plans for future expansion. “We may look at entering one more market (Karnataka or Maharashtra) in the summer.” At present, White Rhino is available in two variants, a Belgian style wheat beer and a Munich style lager priced for more than $2 (<a href="http://www.dfordelhi.in/white-rhino-brewing-company/" target="_blank">Rs 160</a>) in New Delhi and Rs 150 in Gurugram.</p></div><div class="spinner preload-hidden" ng-if="!article.article && article.type === 'spinner'"><div class="bounce1"></div><div class="bounce2"></div><div class="bounce3"></div></div><div class="arrow bounce icon icon-chevron-down preload-hidden" ng-if="!!article.article && article.type === 'spinner'"></div></div><!-- Add Start Gallery Button --><div class="preload-hidden" ng-if="::(article.article.templateType === 'gallery')"><a class="btn-start-gallery" ng-href="{{::gallery_url}}" target="_self">Start Gallery</a></div><!-- Article Guest Contributor Bottom --><div class="article-guest-contrib clearfix preload-hidden" ng-if="article.article.guestContributor && article.article.guestContributor.position === 'bottom'" ng-include="" src="guest_contrib_template"></div><!-- Page controls --><div ng-if="article.article.pages.length > 1 && article.type === 'article'" class="article-pagination preload-hidden"><a ng-href="{{url_path}}{{url_prev}}{{ss}}" ng-if="article.article.page > 0" class="article-pagination-prev" target="_self"><i class="icon icon-chevron-left"></i></a> Page <strong>{{article.article.page + 1}}</strong> / <strong>{{article.article.pages.length}}</strong> <a ng-href="{{url_path}}{{url_next}}{{ss}}" ng-if="article.article.page < article.article.pages.length - 1" class="article-pagination-next" target="_self">Continue <i class="icon icon-chevron-right"></i></a></div><!-- THIS NEEDS TO MOVE FROM HERE --><div class="article-comment preload-hidden" ng-class="{'mobile-comment' : is_mobile}" ng-if="article.type === 'article'"><a class="comments-link" ng-if="article.article.showComments" ng-click="openComments(article.index)" data-track="article-comment-this"><div class="comments-cta" ng-class="{'no-comments' : !article.article.calledOutCommentCount}"><div class="count"><strong>{{article.article.calledOutCommentCount||''}}</strong></div><span>Comment on this story</span></div></a></div><div article-sharing="" class="article-bottom-sharing article-sharing preload-hidden" data-track="body-bottom"></div><!-- Prints, Reprints & corrections bar --><div class="article-print-bar preload-hidden" ng-if="article.type === 'article'"><ul><li class="print"><a ng-href="{{url_path}}print/" target="_blank">Print</a></li><li><a href="mailto:feedback@forbes.com">Send Us Feedback</a></li><li><a ng-click="openCorrectionsEmail()">Report Corrections</a></li><li><a href="http://forbesreprints.magreprints.com" target="_blank">Reprints &amp; Permissions</a></li></ul></div><!-- Related ads--><div class="related-ads-container" ng-if="article.type === 'article'"><!-- Media net related links --><div id="media_net_0_article_{{article.index}}" class="media_net_related_links initialized anim" article-related-links="{{article.index}}"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="speed-bump-wrapper" ng-if="article.type === 'article'"><!-- Around the web ad --><div class="article-speed-bump" speed-bump=""></div></div></div></div><div ng-if="article.type === 'stream' && is_mobile && article.stream && article.stream.length > 0" id="article-bottom-stream" class="article-stream-container clearfix preload-hidden"><div class="article-stream-padding"><div ng-controller="ArticleStreamInlineController" class="clearfix"><h2 class="trending-header">Trending on <i class="logo icon icon-forbes-logo"><span>Forbes</span></i> {{channel_name}}</h2><section class="article-post-article"><div ng-include="" src="article_stream_template"></div></section></div></div></div></article></div><div intx-ad=""></div></section></div></div><div class="sticky-fbs-ad-container preload-hidden" ng-if="is_mobile && !no_ads_template"><div id="mobile-sticky" dynamic-ad-unit="mobile" class="ad mobile-sticky-fbs-ad anim"></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript">setTimeout(function() {
