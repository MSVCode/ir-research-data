Per the <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/social-media/\" target=\"_blank\">Pew Research Center</a>, as of January, 70% of Americans use social media for entertainment, connection, and news.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Social media helped one person rise from the bottom of the Republican rankings to President of the United States,&rdquo; per Pirtle. With eight months left to go until the general election, President Trump had an estimated <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html\" target=\"_blank\">$2 billion in free media</a> coverage. This allowed Trump to <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/trump-spent-about-half-of-what-clinton-did-on-his-way-to-the-presidency.html\" target=\"_blank\">spend about half</a> of what Clinton spent on his way to the presidency, at $238.9 million compared to $450.6 million. Pirtle believes &ldquo;if we teach the right people how to use social media, they can be the leaders of tomorrow.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_106\" photocredit=\"Nathan Allen Pirtle\"  align=\"\" width=\"1200\"]<img class=\"wp-image-106 size-large\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/karimabouelnaga/files/2017/03/Nathan-Allen-Pirtle-1200x1220.jpg?width=960\" alt=\"Nathan Allen Pirtle, Founder and CEO, Worth With The Coach (Photo by ___)\" data-height=\"1220\" data-width=\"1200\"> Nathan Allen Pirtle, Founder and CEO, Work With The Coach (Photo by David Wagner)[/caption]\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Pirtle founded a digital media company called <a href=\"http://workwiththecoach.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Work With The Coach</a> to help leaders connect authentically with their fans and consumers. &ldquo;Nobody wants to be sold to on social media,&rdquo; Pirtle says. &ldquo;When you engage with your fans in a genuine way, the fans will organically spark business,&rdquo; Pirtle added. His start is a testament to just that. Pirtle landed Wyclef Jean, one of his more recent celebrity clients, through a cold tweet.\r\n\r\nAnd though it might seem like Pirtle was always at the top, his life&rsquo;s journey tells otherwise. Pirtle was born in East St. Louis and raised in Decatur, IL. The cities rank as being safer than <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/il/east-st-louis/crime\" target=\"_blank\">3%</a> of other cities and <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/il/decatur/crime\" target=\"_blank\">12%</a> of other cities in the U.S., respectively. After years of disenchantment with school, Pirtle dropped out when he made it to 10th grade. The next few years were marked by instability. He did what he needed to do to fit in and avoid standing out. Before he knew it, he was arrested for an armed robbery and was looking at a prison sentence of 15 years to life. Pirtle caught a lucky break and got off with six years of probation and only one year in jail.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Pirtle&rsquo;s father passed away and it marked a turning point in his life. &ldquo;I packed up my things, moved out to Los Angeles and picked up jobs at a call center and at Coffee Bean while I was starting my digital media company,&rdquo; he said. He was convinced that social media was the way of the future. The territory is also very familiar. Just a decade ago, Pirtle used to manage an artist&rsquo;s brand and his own page on Myspace. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gift I was always good at. When I started my company, I did it using a $29 app,&rdquo; said Pirtle.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2017/2016-nielsen-social-media-report.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nielson published</a> a study that showed adults 18 and over, on average, spent over five hours per week on social media &ndash; with the heaviest users spending over three hours per day. &ldquo;[tweet_quote display=\"Social media is one of the biggest opportunities companies have to connect directly to consumers.\"]Social media is one of the biggest opportunities companies have to connect directly to consumers[/tweet_quote] ,&rdquo; the report stated. Pirtle echoed this same sentiment.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Most digital media companies advise people on how to build their brands but they don&rsquo;t have people engaging or following them on their own platforms. Digital marketing and social media should be about letting people into your life and helping them feel like family,&rdquo; he said. Today, Pirtle has 1.7M followers on Twitter. His company has several notable celebrity clients and has worked with Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Wyclef Jean, and Paula Abdul. He&rsquo;s been credited for <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/julesschroeder/2016/11/29/25-marketing-influencers-to-watch-in-2017/\">worldwide trends</a> and each month reaches over 100M between his Twitter following and client list.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\nHis following and what he calls &ldquo;family base&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t really start to grow until he owned his story. Pirtle shared, &ldquo;at first, I was afraid to tell my story because I believed that people would judge me. One day I just put it all out there. I accepted that I wasn&rsquo;t perfect and I will never be perfect. Once I came to terms with my mistakes and the things I did wrong, people started to respond positively to it. They were able to relate to me on another level because we all have skeletons in our closets, we all have secrets, and we&rsquo;ve all done things we wish we didn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo; The rise of social media has provided us with an opportunity to augment our reach and our presence.\r\n\r\nThis work for Pirtle goes beyond his day to day. He believes that minorities need more role models who aren&rsquo;t just athletes and entertainers. He believes that if black boys pursued coding, medicine, and business with the same vigor they do becoming a rapper and an athlete then we&rsquo;d have more black men doctors, programmers, and entrepreneurs. Speaking from his personal experience, &ldquo;there aren&rsquo;t that many minorities in digital media. I want my story to inspire. I want to be that one piece of hope when it feels like there is no hope,&rdquo; Pirtle concluded.</p>","description":"Nathan Allen Pirtle went from gang life to successful entrepreneur.

Per the <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/social-media/\" target=\"_blank\">Pew Research Center</a>, as of January, 70% of Americans use social media for entertainment, connection, and news.</p>\n<p>“Social media helped one person rise from the bottom of the Republican rankings to President of the United States,” per Pirtle. With eight months left to go until the general election, President Trump had an estimated <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html\" target=\"_blank\">$2 billion in free media</a> coverage. This allowed Trump to <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/trump-spent-about-half-of-what-clinton-did-on-his-way-to-the-presidency.html\" target=\"_blank\">spend about half</a> of what Clinton spent on his way to the presidency, at $238.9 million compared to $450.6 million. Pirtle believes “if we teach the right people how to use social media, they can be the leaders of tomorrow.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_106\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"> \n <div class=\"article-body-image\"> \n  <img class=\"wp-image-106 size-large\" src=\"//blogs-images.forbes.com/karimabouelnaga/files/2017/03/Nathan-Allen-Pirtle-1200x1220.jpg?width=960\" alt=\"Nathan Allen Pirtle, Founder and CEO, Worth With The Coach (Photo by ___)\" data-height=\"1220\" data-width=\"1200\" /> \n  <p class=\"article-photo-credit\">Nathan Allen Pirtle</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nathan Allen Pirtle, Founder and CEO, Work With The Coach (Photo by David Wagner)</p> \n</div>\n<p>In 2014, Pirtle founded a digital media company called <a href=\"http://workwiththecoach.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Work With The Coach</a> to help leaders connect authentically with their fans and consumers. “Nobody wants to be sold to on social media,” Pirtle says. “When you engage with your fans in a genuine way, the fans will organically spark business,” Pirtle added. His start is a testament to just that. Pirtle landed Wyclef Jean, one of his more recent celebrity clients, through a cold tweet.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>And though it might seem like Pirtle was always at the top, his life’s journey tells otherwise. Pirtle was born in East St. Louis and raised in Decatur, IL. The cities rank as being safer than <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/il/east-st-louis/crime\" target=\"_blank\">3%</a> of other cities and <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/il/decatur/crime\" target=\"_blank\">12%</a> of other cities in the U.S., respectively. After years of disenchantment with school, Pirtle dropped out when he made it to 10th grade. The next few years were marked by instability. He did what he needed to do to fit in and avoid standing out. Before he knew it, he was arrested for an armed robbery and was looking at a prison sentence of 15 years to life. Pirtle caught a lucky break and got off with six years of probation and only one year in jail.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>In 2013, Pirtle’s father passed away and it marked a turning point in his life. “I packed up my things, moved out to Los Angeles and picked up jobs at a call center and at Coffee Bean while I was starting my digital media company,” he said. He was convinced that social media was the way of the future. The territory is also very familiar. Just a decade ago, Pirtle used to manage an artist’s brand and his own page on Myspace. “It’s a gift I was always good at. When I started my company, I did it using a $29 app,” said Pirtle.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2017/2016-nielsen-social-media-report.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nielson published</a> a study that showed adults 18 and over, on average, spent over five hours per week on social media – with the heaviest users spending over three hours per day. “<span class=\"tweet_quote\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fkarimabouelnaga%2F2017%2F03%2F22%2Fnathan-allen-pirtle%2F&amp;text=Social%20media%20is%20one%20of%20the%20biggest%20opportunities%20companies%20have%20to%20connect%20directly%20to%20consumers.\" target=\"_blank\">Social media is one of the biggest opportunities companies have to connect directly to consumers<span></span></a></span> ,” the report stated. Pirtle echoed this same sentiment.</p>\n<p>“Most digital media companies advise people on how to build their brands but they don’t have people engaging or following them on their own platforms. Digital marketing and social media should be about letting people into your life and helping them feel like family,” he said. Today, Pirtle has 1.7M followers on Twitter. His company has several notable celebrity clients and has worked with Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Wyclef Jean, and Paula Abdul. He’s been credited for <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/julesschroeder/2016/11/29/25-marketing-influencers-to-watch-in-2017/\" target=\"_self\">worldwide trends</a> and each month reaches over 100M between his Twitter following and client list.</p>","<p>His following and what he calls “family base” didn’t really start to grow until he owned his story. Pirtle shared, “at first, I was afraid to tell my story because I believed that people would judge me. One day I just put it all out there. I accepted that I wasn’t perfect and I will never be perfect. Once I came to terms with my mistakes and the things I did wrong, people started to respond positively to it. They were able to relate to me on another level because we all have skeletons in our closets, we all have secrets, and we’ve all done things we wish we didn’t do.” The rise of social media has provided us with an opportunity to augment our reach and our presence.</p>\n<p>This work for Pirtle goes beyond his day to day. He believes that minorities need more role models who aren’t just athletes and entertainers. He believes that if black boys pursued coding, medicine, and business with the same vigor they do becoming a rapper and an athlete then we’d have more black men doctors, programmers, and entrepreneurs. Speaking from his personal experience, “there aren’t that many minorities in digital media. I want my story to inspire. I want to be that one piece of hope when it feels like there is no hope,” Pirtle concluded.</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"doNotPaginate":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_14","channelName":"Under 30","url":"/under30","displayName":"Under

Per the <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/social-media/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a>, as of January, 70% of Americans use social media for entertainment, connection, and news.</p>
<p>“Social media helped one person rise from the bottom of the Republican rankings to President of the United States,” per Pirtle. With eight months left to go until the general election, President Trump had an estimated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html" target="_blank">$2 billion in free media</a> coverage. This allowed Trump to <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/trump-spent-about-half-of-what-clinton-did-on-his-way-to-the-presidency.html" target="_blank">spend about half</a> of what Clinton spent on his way to the presidency, at $238.9 million compared to $450.6 million. Pirtle believes “if we teach the right people how to use social media, they can be the leaders of tomorrow.”</p>

</div>
<p>In 2014, Pirtle founded a digital media company called <a href="http://workwiththecoach.com/" target="_blank">Work With The Coach</a> to help leaders connect authentically with their fans and consumers. “Nobody wants to be sold to on social media,” Pirtle says. “When you engage with your fans in a genuine way, the fans will organically spark business,” Pirtle added. His start is a testament to just that. Pirtle landed Wyclef Jean, one of his more recent celebrity clients, through a cold tweet.</p>
<div id="inread" article-ad-inbody="inread" class="inread"></div>
<p>And though it might seem like Pirtle was always at the top, his life’s journey tells otherwise. Pirtle was born in East St. Louis and raised in Decatur, IL. The cities rank as being safer than <a href="https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/il/east-st-louis/crime" target="_blank">3%</a> of other cities and <a href="https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/il/decatur/crime" target="_blank">12%</a> of other cities in the U.S., respectively. After years of disenchantment with school, Pirtle dropped out when he made it to 10th grade. The next few years were marked by instability. He did what he needed to do to fit in and avoid standing out. Before he knew it, he was arrested for an armed robbery and was looking at a prison sentence of 15 years to life. Pirtle caught a lucky break and got off with six years of probation and only one year in jail.</p>
<div class="vestpocket" vest-pocket=""></div>
<p>In 2013, Pirtle’s father passed away and it marked a turning point in his life. “I packed up my things, moved out to Los Angeles and picked up jobs at a call center and at Coffee Bean while I was starting my digital media company,” he said. He was convinced that social media was the way of the future. The territory is also very familiar. Just a decade ago, Pirtle used to manage an artist’s brand and his own page on Myspace. “It’s a gift I was always good at. When I started my company, I did it using a $29 app,” said Pirtle.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2017/2016-nielsen-social-media-report.html" target="_blank">Nielson published</a> a study that showed adults 18 and over, on average, spent over five hours per week on social media – with the heaviest users spending over three hours per day. “<span class="tweet_quote"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fkarimabouelnaga%2F2017%2F03%2F22%2Fnathan-allen-pirtle%2F&amp;text=Social%20media%20is%20one%20of%20the%20biggest%20opportunities%20companies%20have%20to%20connect%20directly%20to%20consumers." target="_blank">Social media is one of the biggest opportunities companies have to connect directly to consumers<span></span></a></span> ,” the report stated. Pirtle echoed this same sentiment.</p>
<p>“Most digital media companies advise people on how to build their brands but they don’t have people engaging or following them on their own platforms. Digital marketing and social media should be about letting people into your life and helping them feel like family,” he said. Today, Pirtle has 1.7M followers on Twitter. His company has several notable celebrity clients and has worked with Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Wyclef Jean, and Paula Abdul. He’s been credited for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/julesschroeder/2016/11/29/25-marketing-influencers-to-watch-in-2017/" target="_self">worldwide trends</a> and each month reaches over 100M between his Twitter following and client list.</p></div><div class="spinner preload-hidden" ng-if="!article.article && article.type === 'spinner'"><div class="bounce1"></div><div class="bounce2"></div><div class="bounce3"></div></div><div class="arrow bounce icon icon-chevron-down preload-hidden" ng-if="!!article.article && article.type === 'spinner'"></div></div><!-- Add Start Gallery Button --><div class="preload-hidden" ng-if="::(article.article.templateType === 'gallery')"><a class="btn-start-gallery" ng-href="{{::gallery_url}}" target="_self">Start Gallery</a></div><!-- Article Guest Contributor Bottom --><div class="article-guest-contrib clearfix preload-hidden" ng-if="article.article.guestContributor && article.article.guestContributor.position === 'bottom'" ng-include="" src="guest_contrib_template"></div><!-- Page controls --><div ng-if="article.article.pages.length > 1 && article.type === 'article'" class="article-pagination preload-hidden"><a ng-href="{{url_path}}{{url_prev}}{{ss}}" ng-if="article.article.page > 0" class="article-pagination-prev" target="_self"><i class="icon icon-chevron-left"></i></a> Page <strong>{{article.article.page + 1}}</strong> / <strong>{{article.article.pages.length}}</strong> <a ng-href="{{url_path}}{{url_next}}{{ss}}" ng-if="article.article.page < article.article.pages.length - 1" class="article-pagination-next" target="_self">Continue <i class="icon icon-chevron-right"></i></a></div><!-- THIS NEEDS TO MOVE FROM HERE --><div class="article-comment preload-hidden" ng-class="{'mobile-comment' : is_mobile}" ng-if="article.type === 'article'"><a class="comments-link" ng-if="article.article.showComments" ng-click="openComments(article.index)" data-track="article-comment-this"><div class="comments-cta" ng-class="{'no-comments' : !article.article.calledOutCommentCount}"><div class="count"><strong>{{article.article.calledOutCommentCount||''}}</strong></div><span>Comment on this story</span></div></a></div><div article-sharing="" class="article-bottom-sharing article-sharing preload-hidden" data-track="body-bottom"></div><!-- Prints, Reprints & corrections bar --><div class="article-print-bar preload-hidden" ng-if="article.type === 'article'"><ul><li class="print"><a ng-href="{{url_path}}print/" target="_blank">Print</a></li><li><a href="mailto:feedback@forbes.com">Send Us Feedback</a></li><li><a ng-click="openCorrectionsEmail()">Report Corrections</a></li><li><a href="http://forbesreprints.magreprints.com" target="_blank">Reprints &amp; Permissions</a></li></ul></div><!-- Related ads--><div class="related-ads-container" ng-if="article.type === 'article'"><!-- Media net related links --><div id="media_net_0_article_{{article.index}}" class="media_net_related_links initialized anim" article-related-links="{{article.index}}"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="speed-bump-wrapper" ng-if="article.type === 'article'"><!-- Around the web ad --><div class="article-speed-bump" speed-bump=""></div></div></div></div><div ng-if="article.type === 'stream' && is_mobile && article.stream && article.stream.length > 0" id="article-bottom-stream" class="article-stream-container clearfix preload-hidden"><div class="article-stream-padding"><div ng-controller="ArticleStreamInlineController" class="clearfix"><h2 class="trending-header">Trending on <i class="logo icon icon-forbes-logo"><span>Forbes</span></i> {{channel_name}}</h2><section class="article-post-article"><div ng-include="" src="article_stream_template"></div></section></div></div></div></article></div><div intx-ad=""></div></section></div></div><div class="sticky-fbs-ad-container preload-hidden" ng-if="is_mobile && !no_ads_template"><div id="mobile-sticky" dynamic-ad-unit="mobile" class="ad mobile-sticky-fbs-ad anim"></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript">setTimeout(function() {
