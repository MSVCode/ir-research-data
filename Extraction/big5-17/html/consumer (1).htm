This alone&nbsp;sets them apart from other millennials[/tweet_quote] in a most fundamental way.\r\n\r\n<strong>The one-child generation</strong>\r\n\r\nStarting from 1979, China implemented the \"One-Child Policy\" in an effort to control its population growth. The policy lasted for&nbsp;almost 40 years and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2017/03/07/aging-china-considers-incentives-to-boost-child-birth-too-little-too-late/#6d3bc86a353e\">was only ended recently.</a> During this period, each family in urban China was allowed to have only one child.\r\n\r\nChinese millennials, aged 19 to 35, were all born during the \"One-Child Policy\" period. These \"little emperors\" and \"little empresses,\" as they are often known because of their singular importance within a family unit, were at the center of their universe when they grew up. They are privileged, entitled and enjoy a good life.\r\n\r\n<strong>A privileged generation</strong>\r\n\r\nChinese millennials grew up during China&rsquo;s economic reforms and opening. They have only experienced good times. They have never known the hardships of older generations. To them, life has been good and will only get better.\r\n\r\nThey are a privileged generation who benefited significantly from the economic reforms. They also have advantages that their western counterparts don't have. As I wrote&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/helenwang/2016/10/09/two-reasons-why-chinese-millennials-have-more-cash-to-burn/#421f13af5e81\">here</a>, they don't have student loan debt because their parents pay for their educations. Many don't have housing expenses because their parents or grandparents have bought homes&nbsp;for them.\r\n\r\nIt's no surprise that they are free spenders. Without student loan debt and housing expenses, Chinese millennials are free to&nbsp;spend all of their incomes.\r\n\r\n<strong>An entitled generation</strong>\r\n\r\nBecause Chinese millennials are only children in their families, they are often the center of attention.&nbsp;Their parents want to give them the best and are eager to satisfy their every wishes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, their grandparents also want to spoil them. Many grandparents give their \"only grandchilden\"&nbsp;large sums of money on occasions such as birthdays, weddings and Chinese New Year.\r\n\r\nThis kind of upbringing makes them feel entitled. Some have an inflated sense of self. As consumers, they are extremely demanding. They want good products and services, and they want them fast.\r\n\r\n<strong>A fun-loving generation</strong>\r\n\r\nChinese millennials grew up with the internet and social media. But because they were only children and didn't have siblings to play with,&nbsp;they turned to the internet as a medium for socializing and entertainment.\r\n\r\nThat's why they are extremely active on social media such as Weibo and WeChat, much more so than their western counterparts.&nbsp;A search on Baidu for \"post-90s\" (those who were born after 1990) returns&nbsp;images of selfies, punk rock hairstyles, pre-ripped jeans and even random acts like lighting a cigarette with a burning 100 yuan note (about $13).\r\n\r\nThey want to enjoy life and have fun. Few want to work hard. Because they grew up socializing and having fun online, shopping to them is not just shopping. It&rsquo;s socializing and entertainment all merged together.\r\n<p class=\"tweet_line\">[tweet_quote display=\"Chinese millennials have many facets. They can be narcissistic and socially conscious at the same time.\"]Chinese millennials have many facets. They can be narcissistic and socially conscious at the same time.[/tweet_quote] They are both nationalistic and westernized. They are more individualistic than older generations, but they also yearn for recognition and yield to conformity.\r\n\r\nAs a consumer group, they are very promising. They will affect the future of retail in a most profound way.</p>","description":"Chinese millennials are the only-child generation that sets them apart from other millennials.","image":"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/609271295/960x0.jpg?fit=scale","type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/helenwang/2017/03/27/the-real-reason-chinese-millennials-are-super-consumers/","comments":[],"visible":true,"blogId":"1146","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/373","name":"Helen H.

This alone&nbsp;sets them apart from other millennials<span></span></a></span> in a most fundamental way.</p>\n<p><strong>The one-child generation</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from 1979, China implemented the &quot;One-Child Policy&quot; in an effort to control its population growth. The policy lasted for&nbsp;almost 40 years and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2017/03/07/aging-china-considers-incentives-to-boost-child-birth-too-little-too-late/#6d3bc86a353e\" target=\"_self\">was only ended recently.</a> During this period, each family in urban China was allowed to have only one child.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>Chinese millennials, aged 19 to 35, were all born during the &quot;One-Child Policy&quot; period. These &quot;little emperors&quot; and &quot;little empresses,&quot; as they are often known because of their singular importance within a family unit, were at the center of their universe when they grew up. They are privileged, entitled and enjoy a good life.</p>\n<p><strong>A privileged generation</strong></p>\n<p>Chinese millennials grew up during China’s economic reforms and opening. They have only experienced good times. They have never known the hardships of older generations. To them, life has been good and will only get better.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>They are a privileged generation who benefited significantly from the economic reforms. They also have advantages that their western counterparts don't have. As I wrote&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/helenwang/2016/10/09/two-reasons-why-chinese-millennials-have-more-cash-to-burn/#421f13af5e81\" target=\"_self\">here</a>, they don't have student loan debt because their parents pay for their educations. Many don't have housing expenses because their parents or grandparents have bought homes&nbsp;for them.</p>\n<p>It's no surprise that they are free spenders. Without student loan debt and housing expenses, Chinese millennials are free to&nbsp;spend all of their incomes.</p>\n<p><strong>An entitled generation</strong></p>\n<p>Because Chinese millennials are only children in their families, they are often the center of attention.&nbsp;Their parents want to give them the best and are eager to satisfy their every wishes.</p>\n<p>In addition, their grandparents also want to spoil them. Many grandparents give their &quot;only grandchilden&quot;&nbsp;large sums of money on occasions such as birthdays, weddings and Chinese New Year.</p>\n<p>This kind of upbringing makes them feel entitled. Some have an inflated sense of self. As consumers, they are extremely demanding. They want good products and services, and they want them fast.</p>\n<p><strong>A fun-loving generation</strong></p>\n<p>Chinese millennials grew up with the internet and social media. But because they were only children and didn't have siblings to play with,&nbsp;they turned to the internet as a medium for socializing and entertainment.</p>\n<p>That's why they are extremely active on social media such as Weibo and WeChat, much more so than their western counterparts.&nbsp;A search on Baidu for &quot;post-90s&quot; (those who were born after 1990) returns&nbsp;images of selfies, punk rock hairstyles, pre-ripped jeans and even random acts like lighting a cigarette with a burning 100 yuan note (about $13).</p>\n<p>They want to enjoy life and have fun. Few want to work hard. Because they grew up socializing and having fun online, shopping to them is not just shopping. It’s socializing and entertainment all merged together.</p>\n<p class=\"tweet_line\"><span class=\"tweet_quote\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fhelenwang%2F2017%2F03%2F27%2Fthe-real-reason-chinese-millennials-are-super-consumers%2F&amp;text=Chinese%20millennials%20have%20many%20facets.%20They%20can%20be%20narcissistic%20and%20socially%20conscious%20at%20the%20same%20time.\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese millennials have many facets.

<p>Early in March, more than 4,000 people gathered at the “Millennial 20/20 Summit” in New York to discuss the power of the millennial generation and how they will affect the future of retail.</p>
<p>Chinese millennials, numbering more than 400 million, are a force to be reckoned with.<span class="tweet_icon"></span> While many have recognized&nbsp;them as ultra-connected consumers, few have realized that this has been caused by their place in history as <span class="tweet_quote"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fhelenwang%2F2017%2F03%2F27%2Fthe-real-reason-chinese-millennials-are-super-consumers%2F&amp;text=Chinese%20millennials%20are%20the%20only-child%20generation%20that%C2%A0sets%20them%20apart%20from%20other%20millennials" target="_blank">the only-child generation. This alone&nbsp;sets them apart from other millennials<span></span></a></span> in a most fundamental way.</p>
<p><strong>The one-child generation</strong></p>
<p>Starting from 1979, China implemented the &quot;One-Child Policy&quot; in an effort to control its population growth. The policy lasted for&nbsp;almost 40 years and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2017/03/07/aging-china-considers-incentives-to-boost-child-birth-too-little-too-late/#6d3bc86a353e" target="_self">was only ended recently.</a> During this period, each family in urban China was allowed to have only one child.</p>
<div id="inread" article-ad-inbody="inread" class="inread"></div>
<p>Chinese millennials, aged 19 to 35, were all born during the &quot;One-Child Policy&quot; period. These &quot;little emperors&quot; and &quot;little empresses,&quot; as they are often known because of their singular importance within a family unit, were at the center of their universe when they grew up. They are privileged, entitled and enjoy a good life.</p>
<p><strong>A privileged generation</strong></p>
<p>Chinese millennials grew up during China’s economic reforms and opening. They have only experienced good times. They have never known the hardships of older generations. To them, life has been good and will only get better.</p>
<div class="vestpocket" vest-pocket=""></div>
<p>They are a privileged generation who benefited significantly from the economic reforms. They also have advantages that their western counterparts don't have. As I wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/helenwang/2016/10/09/two-reasons-why-chinese-millennials-have-more-cash-to-burn/#421f13af5e81" target="_self">here</a>, they don't have student loan debt because their parents pay for their educations. Many don't have housing expenses because their parents or grandparents have bought homes&nbsp;for them.</p>
<p>It's no surprise that they are free spenders. Without student loan debt and housing expenses, Chinese millennials are free to&nbsp;spend all of their incomes.</p>
<p><strong>An entitled generation</strong></p>
<p>Because Chinese millennials are only children in their families, they are often the center of attention.&nbsp;Their parents want to give them the best and are eager to satisfy their every wishes.</p>
<p>In addition, their grandparents also want to spoil them. Many grandparents give their &quot;only grandchilden&quot;&nbsp;large sums of money on occasions such as birthdays, weddings and Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>This kind of upbringing makes them feel entitled. Some have an inflated sense of self. As consumers, they are extremely demanding. They want good products and services, and they want them fast.</p>
<p><strong>A fun-loving generation</strong></p>
<p>Chinese millennials grew up with the internet and social media. But because they were only children and didn't have siblings to play with,&nbsp;they turned to the internet as a medium for socializing and entertainment.</p>
<p>That's why they are extremely active on social media such as Weibo and WeChat, much more so than their western counterparts.&nbsp;A search on Baidu for &quot;post-90s&quot; (those who were born after 1990) returns&nbsp;images of selfies, punk rock hairstyles, pre-ripped jeans and even random acts like lighting a cigarette with a burning 100 yuan note (about $13).</p>
<p>They want to enjoy life and have fun. Few want to work hard. Because they grew up socializing and having fun online, shopping to them is not just shopping. It’s socializing and entertainment all merged together.</p>
<p class="tweet_line"><span class="tweet_quote"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fhelenwang%2F2017%2F03%2F27%2Fthe-real-reason-chinese-millennials-are-super-consumers%2F&amp;text=Chinese%20millennials%20have%20many%20facets.%20They%20can%20be%20narcissistic%20and%20socially%20conscious%20at%20the%20same%20time." target="_blank">Chinese millennials have many facets. They can be narcissistic and socially conscious at the same time.<span></span></a></span> They are both nationalistic and westernized. They are more individualistic than older generations, but they also yearn for recognition and yield to conformity.</p>
<p>As a consumer group, they are very promising.
