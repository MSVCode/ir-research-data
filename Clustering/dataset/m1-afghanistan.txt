We doubt this will be enough to win the war, but it is better than the alternatives offered to the president. A complete withdrawal would have been disastrous. The premature withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 paved the way for the rise of the Islamic State, which evolved into an international menace after overrunning much of Iraq and Syria. A similar scenario could have unfolded in Central and South Asia. The Taliban-led insurgency currently contests or controls more territory today than in years. And a withdrawal would have cleared the jihadists’ path to take even more ground, possibly leading to dire ramifications throughout the region. Therefore, President Trump deserves credit for making a decision that went against his gut instinct, which told him to get out.

President Trump was dealt a tough hand in Afghanistan. And as his predecessors (and many of us in the strategic community) have also learned, the United States enjoys only limited influence in this crucial part of the world. U.S. policy is about improving the odds of success — or at least reducing the odds of failure — at this point, not about ensuring any given outcome. In these trying circumstances, with no great policy options available to him, we would especially commend Mr. Trump for making a difficult and very presidential decision about future American policy. We would distill the main goal of U.S. policy for the next three years to be this: Help the Afghan government reverse the momentum of the war. Several years ago, the Afghan government controlled more than 70% of the country. Now, according to U.S. intelligence, that figure is down to more like 60%, and the Taliban believe t"},"date":"2017-08-22"},{"title":"Tennessee's lawmakers react to Donald Trump's Afghanistan strategy","url":"http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2017/08/21/tennessee-lawmakers-react-donald-trump-afghanistan-strategy/586218001/","meta":{"title":"Tennessee's lawmakers praise, call Donald Trump's Afghanistan strategy 'biggest U-turn' yet","description":"Tennessee delegation mostly supports Trump's plan for nation's longest war."},"date":"2017-08-22"},{"title":"Defense Names Take Wall Street Higher After Trump Outlines ...","url":"https://www.thestreet.com/story/14279616/1/defense-names-take-wall-street-higher-after-trump-outlines-afghanistan-strategy.html","meta":{"title":"Defense Names Take Wall Street Higher and BHP Billiton Lifts Materials","description":"Stocks are higher."},"date":"2017-08-22"},{"title":"While India, Afghanistan Hail Trump's South Asia Strategy ...","url":"https://thewire.in/170067/india-afghanistan-pakistan-donald-trump/","meta":{"title":"While India, Afghanistan Hail Trump's South Asia Strategy, Questions Remain on What It Really Means - The Wire","description":"Indian officials have expressed their satisfaction at US President Donald Trump calling Pakistan a \"safe haven\" for \"agents of chaos\"."},"date":"2017-08-22"},{"title":"Stock Futures Higher After Trump Outlines Afghanistan Strategy ...","url":"https://www.thestreet.com/story/14278880/1/stock-futures-higher-as-investors-wait-for-direction-ahead-of-jackson-hole.html","meta":{"title":"Stock Futures Higher After Trump Outlines Afghanistan Strategy","description":"Stock futures are higher."},"date":"2017-08-22"},{"title":"Trump's new strategy for Afghanistan - Daily Nation","url":"http://www.nation.co.ke/news/world/Donald-Trump-strategy-for-Afghanistan/1068-4066042-frb066/index.html","meta":{"title":"Trump's new strategy for Afghanistan","description":"US president backs off withdrawal, to boost military numbers."},"date":"2017-08-22"},{"title":"Angry Trump grilled his generals about Afghanistan troop increase","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/angry-trump-grilled-his-generals-about-afghanistan-troop-increase-1.3194309","meta":{"title":"Angry Trump grilled his generals about Afghanistan troop increase","description":"President gave in after accepting that ‘big military’ approach was needed to protect US"},"date":"2017-08-22"},{"title":"Families of killed soldiers want explanation from Defence Force over ...","url":"http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2017/08/families-of-killed-soldiers-want-explanation-from-defence-force-over-afghanistan.html","meta":{"title":"Families of killed soldiers want explanation from Defence Force over Afghanistan","description":"An intelligence expert says the defence force can't continue to stonewall."},"date":"2017-08-21"},{"title":"How Donald Trump went from 'get out' to 'double down' on Afghanistan","url":"http://nationalpost.com/news/world/how-donald-trump-went-from-get-out-to-double-down-on-afghanistan","meta":{"title":"How Donald Trump went from ‘get out’ to ‘double down’ on Afghanistan","description":"Trump’s new strategy relies on tactics his predecessors used.
